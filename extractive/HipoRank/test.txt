वाल्मीकि जी ने सबसे पूछा एवं सभी ने मना कर दिया। तब वाल्मिकी जी का इस संसार से मोहभंग हो गया और उनका हृदय परिवर्तन हुआ। नारद जी ने उन्हें गुरुदीक्षा दी एवं वे डाकू वाल्मीकि से महर्षि वाल्मीकि बन गए क्योंकि बिना गुरु जीव पार नहीं हो सकता। Valmiki Jayanti 2021: महर्षि वाल्मीकि भी डाकू से महर्षि तब बन पाए जब उन्हें गुरु की शरण प्राप्त हुई। गुरु का इस जीवन में महत्व अनिवार्य है। गुरु ही है जो शिष्य को मिट्टी से सोना या काग से हंस बनाते हैं। महर्षि वाल्मीकि ने ही नहीं ब्रह्मा, विष्णु महेश ने भी गुरु बनाए एवं जब वे अवतारों में लीला करने इस पृथ्वी पर आये तब उन्होंने भी गुरु धारण किए। श्री राम के आध्यात्मिक गुरु वशिष्ठ जी हुए (विश्वामित्र ने उन्हें धनुर्विद्या की शिक्षा दी थी) और कृष्ण जी के आध्यात्मिक गुरु दुर्वासा ऋषि हुए। वहीं संदीपनि ऋषि ने उन्हें अक्षर ज्ञान की शिक्षा दी थी। महर्षि वाल्मीकि ने जो रामायण रची उसकी प्रेरणा उन्हें एक शिकारी द्वारा एक क्रोंच पक्षी के वध से मिली। यही रामायण मूल रामायण है जो संस्कृत भाषा मे लिखी गई थी। इसके वर्षों बाद भक्तिकाल में गोस्वामी तुलसीदास द्वारा रचित रामचरित मानस केवल राम के उदात्त चरित्र का उद्घाटन मात्र है। जब रावण वध और लंका विजय के पश्चात विष्णु अवतार राम अयोध्या लौटे तब कुछ समय उपरांत माता सीता अयोध्या से मर्यादा पुरुषोत्तम श्री राम के द्वारा निष्काषित कर दी गईं। माता सीता उस समय गर्भवती थीं। तब माता सीता ने महर्षि वाल्मीकि की शरण में आश्रय लिया। माता सीता ने कुछ समय उपरांत पुत्र लव कुश को जन्म दिया जिनकी शिक्षा दीक्षा का कार्यभार महर्षि वाल्मीकि ने स्वयं सम्भाला। विष्णु अवतार दशरथ पुत्र राम अलग हैं एवं आदिराम भिन्न हैं। सर्व विदित है कि तुलसी के राम और कबीर साहेब के राम अलग थे। जानकारी के अभाव में कबीर साहेब के राम को अव्यक्त या निर्गुण कहकर पल्ला झाड़ लिया जाता है किंतु स्वयं परमेश्वर कबीर ने स्पष्ट किया है कि उनके राम आदि राम हैं। आदिराम कौन है? आदिराम है इस सृष्टि का रचयिता, ब्रह्मा, विष्णु, महेश का रचयिता, सबका पालन कर्ता, गीता में कहा गया सच्चिदानंद घन ब्रह्म, सबसे शक्तिशाली और विधि का विधान पलट सकने के सामर्थ्य रखने वाला परमेश्वर है आदिराम। आदिराम, क्षर पुरुष और अक्षर पुरुष से भी ऊपर है परम् अक्षर पुरुष। परमेश्वर कबीर ने इसे सृष्टि रचना बताते हुए स्पष्ट किया है और केवल दशरथ पुत्र राम को भजने वाले इस संसार को वास्तविक राम से दूर बौराया हुआ बताया है। धर्मदास यह जग बौराना | कोइ न जाने पद निरवाना || यहि कारन मैं कथा पसारा | जगसे कहियों राम नियारा || भरम गये जग वेद पुराना | आदि रामका का भेद न जाना || राम राम सब जगत बखाने | आदि राम कोइ बिरला जाने || ज्ञानी सुने सो हिरदै लगाई | मूर्ख सुने सो गम्य ना पाई || सारी सृष्टि रचना से स्पष्ट है कि ब्रह्मा ,विष्णु ,महेश के पिता हैं ज्योति निरजंन और माता हैं अष्टंगी यानी दुर्गा। आदिराम हैं इन सभी के पिता, जनक और पालनहार, परमेश्वर कबीर। ■ यह भी पढ़ें: सृष्टि रचना यहाँ पढ़ सकते हैं ज्योति निरजंन और अष्टंगी के कुकर्म के कारण उन्हें 21 ब्रह्मांडो सहित सतलोक से सोलह शंख कोस की दूरी पर निष्काषित किया गया। सतलोक में कीन्हा दुराचारि, काल निरजंन दिन्हा निकारि । माया समेत दिया भगाई, सोलह शंख कोस दूरी पर आई || इसके साथ ही काल यानी ज्योति निरजंन को एक लाख मानव शरीरधारी प्राणियों को खाने एवं सवा लाख नित्य उत्पन्न करने का श्राप मिला है। आज हम इस लोक में कर्म बंधन में पड़े कभी मनुष्य, कभी कुंजर, कभी कीड़ी (चींटी) बनकर कष्ट भोग रहे हैं। इस लोक में जो आग दुःख और कष्ट की लगी है यह कभी न बुझने की है। यहाँ से अपने अविनाशी और सुखमय लोक लौट चलने में ही समझदारी है। आज जिन अवतारों एवं ब्रह्मा विष्णु शिव की पूजा समाज कर रहा है उनकी उपासना तो गीता अध्याय 7 श्लोक 14 से 17 में वर्जित बताई हैं। वेदों में केवल परम् अक्षर ब्रह्म के विषय में बताया गया है जो सभी पापों को क्षमा कर सकता है, विधि के विधान को पलट सकता है एवं वह बन्दीछोड़ है अर्थात सभी बन्धनों का शत्रु। तीन पुत्र अष्टंगी जाये | ब्रह्मा विष्णु शिव नाम धराये || तीन देव विस्तार चलाये |इनमें यह जग धोखा खाये || पुरुष गम्य कैसे को पावै | काल निरंजन जग भरमावै || काल निरजंन ने सभी को भ्रमित कर रखा है। इस लोक से निकलने का रास्ता केवल तत्वदर्शी सन्त ही बता सकता है। गीता अध्याय 4 के श्लोक 34 में तत्वदर्शी सन्त की शरण में जाने के किये कहा है तथा अध्याय 15 के श्लोक 4 में बताया है कि तत्वदर्शी सन्त यानी तत्व को जानने वाले की खोज के पश्चात उस परम पद की खोज करनी चाहिए जहाँ जाने के बाद जीव पुनः इस संसार मे लौटकर नहीं आता। इस लोक के स्वर्ग महास्वर्ग तो नष्ट हो जाते हैं (गीता अध्याय 8 श्लोक 16)। सतलोक पूर्ण परमेश्वर की राजधानी है। हमारा निजस्थान है। जहां दुख, निराशा, अवसाद, रोग, बुढ़ापा, जन्म और मरण नहीं है। न ही कर्म बंधन हैं अर्थात बिना कर्म किये फल प्राप्त होते रहते हैं। तत्वदर्शी सन्त हर समय पृथ्वी पर नहीं होता। जिस साधना के लिए अनेकों ऋषि, महर्षि, ब्रह्मर्षि तरस गए वह आज हमें सहज उपलब्ध है। आज पूरे विश्व मे एकमात्र तत्वदर्शी सन्त हैं जगतगुरु रामपाल जी महाराज। अधिक जानकारी के लिए देखें सतलोक आश्रम यूट्यूब चैनल तथा अविलंब तत्वदर्शी सन्त की शरण में आएं। ब्रह्म काल सकल जग जाने | आदि ब्रह्मको ना पहिचाने || तीनों देव और औतारा | ताको भजे सकल संसारा || तीनों गुणका यह विस्तारा | धर्मदास मैं कहों पुकारा || गुण तीनों की भक्ति में, भूल परो संसार | कहै कबीर निज नाम बिन, कैसे उतरें पार || Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

को अंग्रेजी की पहली कक्षा में प्रवेश लिया। इसी दिन से उनके शैक्षिक जीवन का आरम्भ हुआ था, इसलिए ७ नवंबर को महाराष्ट्र में विद्यार्थी दिवस रूप में मनाया जाता हैं। उस समय उन्हें \'भिवा\' कहकर बुलाया जाता था। स्कूल में उस समय \'भिवा रामजी आंबेडकर\' यह उनका नाम उपस्थिति पंजिका में क्रमांक - 1914 पर अंकित था। जब वे अंग्रेजी चौथी कक्षा की परीक्षा उत्तीर्ण हुए, तब क्योंकि यह अछूतों में असामान्य बात थी, इसलिए भीमराव की इस सफलता को अछूतों के बीच सार्वजनिक समारोह के रूप में मनाया गया, और उनके परिवार के मित्र एवं लेखक दादा केलुस्कर द्वारा स्वलिखित \'बुद्ध की जीवनी\' उन्हें भेंट दी गयी। इसे पढकर उन्होंने पहली बार गौतम बुद्ध व बौद्ध धर्म को जाना एवं उनकी शिक्षा से प्रभावित हुए। माध्यमिक शिक्षा 1897 में, आम्बेडकर का परिवार मुंबई चला गया जहां उन्होंने एल्फिंस्टोन रोड पर स्थित गवर्न्मेंट हाईस्कूल में आगे

किया, जो कि बॉम्बे विश्वविद्यालय से संबद्ध था। इस स्तर पर शिक्षा प्राप्त करने वाले अपने समुदाय से वे पहले व्यक्ति थे। 1912 तक, उन्होंने बॉम्बे विश्वविद्यालय से अर्थशास्त्र और राजनीतिक विज्ञान में कला स्नातक (बी॰ए॰) प्राप्त की, और बड़ौदा राज्य सरकार के साथ काम करने लगे। उनकी पत्नी ने अभी अपने नये परिवार को स्थानांतरित कर दिया था और काम शुरू किया जब उन्हें अपने बीमार पिता को देखने के लिए मुंबई वापस लौटना पड़ा, जिनका 2 फरवरी 1913 को निधन हो गया। कोलंबिया विश्वविद्यालय में स्नातकोत्तर अध्ययन thumb|कोलंबिया विश्वविद्यालय में छात्र के रूप में आम्बेडकर (१९१५-१९१७) १९१३ में, आम्बेडकर २२ वर्ष की आयु में संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका चले गए जहां उन्हें सयाजीराव गायकवाड़ तृतीय (बड़ौदा के गायकवाड़) द्वारा स्थापित एक योजना के अंतर्गत न्यूयॉर्क नगर स्थित कोलंबिया विश्वविद्यालय में स्नातकोत्तर शिक्षा के अवसर प्रदान करने के लिए तीन वर्ष के लिए 11.50 डॉलर प्रति माह बड़ौदा राज्य की छात्रवृत्ति प्रदान की गई थी। वहां पहुँचने के तुरन्त बाद वे लिविंगस्टन हॉल में पारसी मित्र नवल भातेना के साथ बस गए। जून 1915 में उन्होंने अपनी कला स्नातकोत्तर (एम॰ए॰) परीक्षा पास की, जिसमें अर्थशास्त्र प्रमुख विषय, और समाजशास्त्र, इतिहास, दर्शनशास्त्र और मानव विज्ञान यह अन्य विषय थे। उन्होंने स्नातकोत्तर के लिए एंशियंट इंडियन्स कॉमर्स (प्राचीन भारतीय वाणिज्य) विषय पर शोध कार्य प्रस्तुत किया। आम्बेडकर जॉन डेवी और लोकतंत्र पर उनके काम से प्रभावित थे। १९१६ में, उन्हें अपना दूसरा शोध कार्य, नेशनल डिविडेंड ऑफ इंडिया - ए हिस्टोरिक एंड एनालिटिकल स्टडी के लिए दूसरी कला स्नातकोत्तर प्रदान की गई, और अन्ततः उन्होंने लंदन की राह ली। १९१६ में अपने तीसरे शोध कार्य इवोल्युशन ओफ प्रोविन्शिअल फिनान्स इन ब्रिटिश इंडिया के लिए अर्थशास्त्र में पीएचडी प्राप्त की, अपने शोध कार्य को प्रकाशित करने के बाद १९२७ में अधिकृत रुप से पीएचडी प्रदान की गई। ९ मई को, उन्होंने मानव विज्ञानी अलेक्जेंडर गोल्डनवेइज़र द्वारा आयोजित एक सेमिनार में भारत में जातियां: उनकी प्रणाली, उत्पत्ति और विकास नामक एक शोध पत्र प्रस्तुत किया, जो उनका पहला प्रकाशित पत्र था। ३ वर्ष तक की अवधि के लिये मिली हुई छात्रवृत्ति का उपयोग उन्होंने केवल दो वर्षों में अमेरिका में पाठ्यक्रम पूरा करने में किया और १९१६ में वे लंदन गए। लंदन स्कूल ऑफ इकोनॉमिक्स में स्नातकोत्तर अध्ययन thumb|right|250px|लंदन स्कूल ऑफ इकोनॉमिक्स के अपने प्रोफेसरों और दोस्तों के साथ आम्बेडकर (केंद्र

प्रवेश लिया, और साथ ही लंदन स्कूल ऑफ़ इकोनॉमिक्स में भी प्रवेश लिया जहां उन्होंने अर्थशास्त्र की डॉक्टरेट (Doctorate) थीसिस पर काम करना शुरू किया। जून 1917 में, विवश होकर उन्हें अपना अध्ययन अस्थायी तौरपर बीच में ही छोड़ कर भारत लौट आए क्योंकि बड़ौदा राज्य से उनकी छात्रवृत्ति समाप्त हो गई थी। लौटते समय उनके पुस्तक संग्रह को उस जहाज से अलग जहाज पर भेजा गया था जिसे जर्मन पनडुब्बी के टारपीडो द्वारा डुबो दिया गया। ये प्रथम विश्व युद्ध का काल था। उन्हें चार साल के भीतर अपने थीसिस के लिए लंदन लौटने की अनुमति मिली। बड़ौदा राज्य के सेना सचिव के रूप में काम करते हुये अपने जीवन में अचानक फिर से आये भेदभाव से डॉ॰ भीमराव आम्बेडकर निराश हो गये और अपनी नौकरी छोड़ एक निजी ट्यूटर और लेखाकार के रूप में काम करने लगे। यहाँ तक कि उन्होंने अपना परामर्श व्यवसाय भी आरम्भ किया जो उनकी सामाजिक स्थिति के कारण विफल रहा। अपने एक अंग्रेज जानकार मुंबई के पूर्व राज्यपाल लॉर्ड सिडनेम के कारण उन्हें मुंबई के सिडनेम कॉलेज ऑफ कॉमर्स एंड इकोनोमिक्स मे राजनीतिक अर्थव्यवस्था के प्रोफेसर के रूप में नौकरी मिल गयी। १९२० में कोल्हापुर के शाहू महाराज, अपने पारसी मित्र के सहयोग और कुछ निजी बचत के सहयोग से वो एक बार फिर से इंग्लैंड वापस जाने में सफ़ल हो पाए तथा 1921 में विज्ञान स्नातकोत्तर (एम॰एससी॰) प्राप्त की, जिसके लिए उन्होंने \'प्रोवेन्शियल डीसेन्ट्रलाईज़ेशन ऑफ इम्पीरियल फायनेन्स इन ब्रिटिश इण्डिया\' (ब्रिटिश भारत में शाही अर्थ व्यवस्था का प्रांतीय विकेंद्रीकरण) खोज ग्रन्थ प्रस्तुत किया था। 1922 में, उन्हें ग्रेज इन ने बैरिस्टर-एट-लॉज डिग्री प्रदान की और उन्हें ब्रिटिश बार में बैरिस्टर के रूप में प्रवेश मिल गया। 1923 में, उन्होंने अर्थशास्त्र में डी॰एससी॰ (डॉक्टर ऑफ साईंस) उपाधि प्राप्त की। उनकी थीसिस "दी प्राब्लम आफ दि रुपी: इट्स ओरिजिन एंड इट्स सॉल्यूशन" (रुपये की समस्या: इसकी उत्पत्ति और इसका समाधान) पर थी। लंदन का अध्ययन पूर्ण कर भारत वापस लौटते हुये भीमराव आम्बेडकर तीन महीने जर्मनी में रुके, जहाँ उन्होंने अपना अर्थशास्त्र का अध्ययन, बॉन विश्वविद्यालय में जारी रखा। किंतु समय की कमी से वे विश्वविद्यालय में अधिक नहीं ठहर सकें। उनकी तीसरी और चौथी डॉक्टरेट्स (एलएल॰डी॰, कोलंबिया विश्वविद्यालय, 1952 और डी॰लिट॰, उस्मानिया विश्वविद्यालय, 1953) सम्मानित उपाधियाँ थीं।', 'references': ["-गंगा सहाय मीणा- बाबासाहेब डॉक्टर भीमराव आंबेडकर 20वीं सदी के सबसे बड़े विचारकों में एक हैं. वर्तमान सदी भी भारत में डॉ आंबेडकर के प्रभाव की सदी है. डॉ आंबेडकर की लोकप्रियता और स्\u200dवीकार्यता के पीछे उनका विशद अध्\u200dययन, तार्किक लेखन और वंचित समूहों के लिए परिवर्तनकामी भूमिका है. शिक्षा का क्षेत्र भी उनके योगदान से अछूता नहीं है, लेकिन डॉ आंबेडकर का मूल्\u200dयांकन करते वक्\u200dत इसकी कम बात होती है. उनके मशहूर नारे 'शिक्षित बनो, संगठित रहो, संघर्ष करो' में शिक्षा पहले स्\u200dथान पर है. शिक्षा के बारे में उन्होंने कहा, 'शिक्षा वह है, जो व्\u200dयक्ति को निडर बनाये, एकता का पाठ पढ़ाये, लोगों को अधिकारों के प्रति सचेत करे, संघर्ष की सीख दे और आजादी के लिए लड़ना सिखाये.’ डॉ आंबेडकर ने सबसे पहले बॉम्बे लेजिस्\u200dलेटिव काउंसिल में एक कानूनविद की हैसियत से 12 मार्च, 1927 को भारतीय समाज में शिक्षा के बारे में कुछ जरूरी सवाल उठाये. यह उनके लिए बेहद चिंता का विषय था कि हमारे देश ने शिक्षा के मामले में प्रगति नहीं की. उस समय भारत सरकार द्वारा शिक्षा के बारे में प्रस्\u200dतुत रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक देश के स्\u200dकूल जाने की उम्र के लड़कों को 40 साल और लड़कियों को 100 से अधिक साल लगते. इसकी वजह उन्\u200dहोंने शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में बजट की कमी बतायी. वे कहते हैं, 'हम शिक्षा पर कम से कम उतनी राशि तो खर्च करें ही, जितनी हम लोगों से उत्\u200dपाद शुल्\u200dक के रूप में लेते हैं.’ इसी क्रम में डॉ आंबेडकर ने विद्यार्थियों की ड्रॉप-आउट दर पर भी चिंता जतायी. इसके लिए उन्\u200dहोंने उपाय सुझाया कि प्राथमिक शिक्षा पर अधिक से अधिक खर्च किया जाये. आज हम शिक्षा के व्\u200dयावसायीकरण की समस्\u200dया से जूझ रहे हैं. डॉ आंबेडकर ने शिक्षा के व्\u200dयावसायीकरण की समस्\u200dयाओं को सौ साल पहले पहचान लिया था. वे कहते हैं, 'शिक्षा तो एक ऐसी चीज है, जो सबको मिलनी चाहिए. शिक्षा विभाग ऐसा नहीं है, जो इस आधार पर चलाया जाये कि जितना वह खर्च करता है, उतना विद्यार्थियों से वसूल किया जाये. शिक्षा को सभी संभव उपायों से व्\u200dयापक रूप से सस्\u200dता बनाया जाना चाहिए.’ डॉ आंबेडकर के लिए चिंता का मूल विषय था- देश में व्\u200dयाप्\u200dत सामाजिक असमानता. इसको समाप्\u200dत कर देश में समानता लाने में वे शिक्षा की अहम भूमिका मानते थे. उनका माननता था कि शिक्षा सहित जीवन के विविध क्षेत्रों में आर्थिक व सामाजिक दृष्टि से पिछड़ी जातियों के लिए सहानुभूतिपूर्ण रवैये का सिद्घांत अपनाया जाना चाहिए. वे ऐसे लोकतांत्रिक पाठ्यक्रम के पक्षधर थे, जिसे संबंधित विषयों के अध्\u200dयापक विद्यार्थियों और विषय की जरूरत के हिसाब से बनायें. उन्होंने हमेशा पूर्ण एवं अनिवार्य शिक्षा का पक्ष लिया और तकनीकी शिक्षा पर बल दिया. वे कमजोर वर्गों को विभिन्\u200dन प्रकार का छात्रवृत्तियां देने के पक्षधर थे और उच्\u200dच शिक्षा की जरूरत भी वे बराबर रेखांकित करते रहते थे. वे शिक्षा और नौकरियों के क्षेत्र में वंचितों की रुचि जगाने और उनका प्रतिनिधित्\u200dव सुनिश्चित करने के लिए उनके लिए सीटें आरक्षित करने के विचार के जन्\u200dमदाता थे. दलितों और पिछड़ों के साथ डॉ आंबेडकर की प्राथमिकता में स्त्रियों की शिक्षा भी थी. वे स्त्रियों की दुर्दशा के लिए ब्राह्मणवाद को जिम्\u200dमेदार मानते थे. उनका स्\u200dपष्\u200dट कहना था, 'इस समाज में ऐसी कोई बुराई नहीं है, जो ब्राह्मणों के सहयोग के बिना पनपी हो. जाति व्\u200dयवस्\u200dथा जहां पुरुष-पुरूष के बीच भेद करती है, वहीं इसी का विस्\u200dतार करते हुए स्\u200dत्री को दोयम दर्जा देती है.’ डॉ आंबेडकर स्त्रियों के लिए शिक्षा और आर्थिक आत्\u200dमनिर्भरता को आवश्\u200dयक मानते थे. डॉ आंबेडकर ने व्\u200dयक्तिगत स्\u200dतर पर भी शिक्षा, खासतौर पर वंचितों के लिए शिक्षा के लिए कई महत्\u200dवपूर्ण कार्य किये. उन्\u200dहोंने 1924 की शुरूआत में बहिष्\u200dकृत हितकारिणी सभा के गठन से ही इस क्षेत्र में कार्य शुरू कर दिया था. सभा ने शिक्षा को प्राथमिकता बनाया और खासकर पिछड़े वर्गों के बीच उच्\u200dच शिक्षा और संस्\u200dकृति के विस्\u200dतार हेतु कॉलेज, हॉस्\u200dटल, पुस्\u200dकालय, सामाजिक केन्\u200dद्र और अध्\u200dययन केंद्र खोले. सभा की देखरेख में विद्यार्थियों की पहल पर 'सरस्\u200dवती बेलास' नामक एक मासिक पत्रिका का प्रकाशन शुरू हुआ. इसने 1925 में सोलापुर और बेलगांव में छात्रावास और बंबई में मुफ्त अध्\u200dययन केंद्र, हॉकी क्\u200dलब और दो छात्रावास खोले. डॉ आंबेडकर ने 1928 में डिप्रेस्\u200dड क्\u200dलास एजुकेशनल सोसाइटी का गठन किया. उन्\u200dहोंने 1945 में समाज के पिछडे़ तबकों के बीच उच्\u200dच शिक्षा फैलाने के लिए लोक शैक्षिक समाज की भी स्\u200dथापना

I am not sure what influence his years at Columbia University in New York City had on his life, but I know we can be proud to claim some part of this remarkable man\'s early development. Two of the qualities which mark his life and career \x96 optimism and pragmatism \x96 may have been enhanced by his contact with this country, which prides itself on its charactersitics of hope and practicality. The three years Ambedkar spent at Columbia, 1913-1916, awakened, in his own words, his potential. Columbia was in its golden age, and a list of Ambedkar\'s professors reads like a catalog of early 20th-century American educators. The transcript of Ambedkar\'s work at Columbia reveals that he audited many classes, more than he could have taken for grades, including such subjects as "railroad economics." Later, Ambedkar wrote, "The best friends I have had in my life were some of my classmates at Columbia and my great professors, John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman and James Harvey Robinson. II (Columbia Alumni News, December 19, 1930). Although it was Edwin Seligman, Professor of Economics, with whom Ambedkar kept in touch after he left Columbia and to whom he sent students when he taught at Sydenham college in Bombay, John Dewey seems to have had the greatest influence on him. Dewey\'s pragmatic philosophy, his theories associated with optimistic, pragmatic American democracy, which preached (although it did not always practice) equality, no barriers to upward mobility, the use of machinery to produce leisure, and an attitude of respect for every individual. Ambedkar\'s first political party, the Independent Labour Party founded in 1936, took its name from British politics. But two things lessened the importance of Britain for Ambedkar: the colonial presence of the British in India, and the preference of British liberals for Gandhi and his non-violent direct action campaigns for independence over Ambedkar and the slow parliamentary path. And it also seems likely that American optimism, and the lack of an obvious class system in America, met a natural response in Ambedkar. Ambedkar\'s American contacts did not end when he left Columbia University in June, 1916, although one must admit they became minimal. He continued to correspond with Edwin Seligman, his mentor in Economics at Columbia, and occasionally recommended Indian students to Seligman. In 1930, Ambedkar wrote an article for the Columbia alumni magazine which reveals quite a sentimental attachment: "The best friends I have had in my life were some of my classmates at Columbia and my great professors, John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman and James Harvey Robinson." In 1952, Ambedkar went back to Columbia to receive an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and it is clear that this recognition of his work meant much to him. It was in this period of the early 1950\'s that Ambedkar was publicly critical of India\'s foreign policy of non-alignment, which seemed to him to cut India off from American contacts. I shall end this introduction with two stories, since this is not so much a scholarly tract as an essay which attempts to explore an American-Indian cultural interaction in a personal way. Mrs. Savita Ambedkar tells a touching story of Ambedkar\'s happily imitating John Dewey\'s distinctive classroom mannerisms \x96 thirty years after Ambedkar sat in Dewey\'s classes. It is impossible to find in Ambedkar\'s life story any hint of a guru or a personality which dominated him, but here at least is a suggestion that he was fond of both Dewey the philosopher and Dewey the man. The other story concerns a letter of recommendation written about Ambedkar by Edward Cannon, Professor of Political Economy in the University of London, to the head of Sydenham College, where Ambedkar applied for a teaching position in 1918. Professor Cannon wrote: "I don\'t know anything about Ambedkar except that he came to do a thesis and attacked it and me in a way which showed he had quite extraordinary practical ability.... I rather wonder if he is a pure Indian; his character is rather Scotch-American." There is absolutely no doubt that Ambedkar was pure Indian, and no one who knew his background and the history of his caste would assign any other nationality to him. But this depiction of his character as "Scotch-American" rather delights me. Ambedkar\'s pragmatism, his wide-ranging intellectual interests, his realistic approach to social matters, his uncompromising attitude toward those he felt were his opponents \x96 all these factors make his character and work very understandable to an American. Even his bitterness can be understood by an American who has seen social injustice at work in the midst of American democracy. I am tempted to end this introduction to my essay with the thought that American influence on Ambedkar really counted for very little. It is more likely that in those early years in America his own natural proclivities and interests found a healthy soil for growth, and the experience served chiefly to strengthen him in his life-long battle for dignity and equality for his people. The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study. Even today, when Indian students flock to America, their education is generally in the field of technology or science, and they do not enter politics. As far as I have been able to find out, only three men well known in public life have been thoroughly exposed to an American experience: Jay Prakash Narayan; the late Chief Minister of the Punjab, S. Pratap Singh Kairon; and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. An American inevitably wonders what effect his country has had on the lives and thinking of these men. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. The three years Ambedkar spent at Columbia, 1913-1916, awakened, in his own words, his potential. Columbia was in its golden age, and a list of Ambedkar\'s professors reads like a catalog of early 20th-century American educators. The transcript of Ambedkar\'s work at Columbia reveals that he audited many classes, more than he could have taken for grades, including such subjects as "railroad economics." Later, Ambedkar wrote, "The best friends I have had in my life were some of my classmates at Columbia and my great professors, John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman and James Harvey Robinson. II (Columbia Alumni News, December 19, 1930). Although it was Edwin Seligman, Professor of Economics, with whom Ambedkar kept in touch after he left Columbia and to whom he sent students when he taught at Sydenham college in Bombay, John Dewey seems to have had the greatest influence on him. Dewey\'s pragmatic philosophy, his theories associated with optimistic, pragmatic American democracy, which preached (although it did not always practice) equality, no barriers to upward mobility, the use of machinery to produce leisure, and an attitude of respect for every individual. Ambedkar\'s first political party, the Independent Labour Party founded in 1936, took its name from British politics. But two things lessened the importance of Britain for Ambedkar: the colonial presence of the British in India, and the preference of British liberals for Gandhi and his non-violent direct action campaigns for independence over Ambedkar and the slow parliamentary path. And it also seems likely that American optimism, and the lack of an obvious class system in America, met a natural response in Ambedkar. Ambedkar\'s American contacts did not end when he left Columbia University in June, 1916, although one must admit they became minimal. He continued to correspond with Edwin Seligman, his mentor in Economics at Columbia, and occasionally recommended Indian students to Seligman. In 1930, Ambedkar wrote an article for the Columbia alumni magazine which reveals quite a sentimental attachment: "The best friends I have had in my life were some of my classmates at Columbia and my great professors, John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman and James Harvey Robinson." In 1952, Ambedkar went back to Columbia to receive an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and it is clear that this recognition of his work meant much to him. It was in this period of the early 1950\'s that Ambedkar was publicly critical of India\'s foreign policy of non-alignment, which seemed to him to cut India off from American contacts. I shall end this introduction with two stories, since this is not so much a scholarly tract as an essay which attempts to explore an American-Indian cultural interaction in a personal way. Mrs. Savita Ambedkar tells a touching story of Ambedkar\'s happily imitating John Dewey\'s distinctive classroom mannerisms \x96 thirty years after Ambedkar sat in Dewey\'s classes. It is impossible to find in Ambedkar\'s life story any hint of a guru or a personality which dominated him, but here at least is a suggestion that he was fond of both Dewey the philosopher and Dewey the man. The other story concerns a letter of recommendation written about Ambedkar by Edward Cannon, Professor of Political Economy in the University of London, to the head of Sydenham College, where Ambedkar applied for a teaching position in 1918. Professor Cannon wrote: "I don\'t know anything about Ambedkar except that he came to do a thesis and attacked it and me in a way which showed he had quite extraordinary practical ability.... I rather wonder if he is a pure Indian; his character is rather Scotch-American." There is absolutely no doubt that Ambedkar was pure Indian, and no one who knew his background and the history of his caste would assign any other nationality to him. But this depiction of his character as "Scotch-American" rather delights me. Ambedkar\'s pragmatism, his wide-ranging intellectual interests, his realistic approach to social matters, his uncompromising attitude toward those he felt were his opponents \x96 all these factors make his character and work very understandable to an American. Even his bitterness can be understood by an American who has seen social injustice at work in the midst of American democracy. I am tempted to end this introduction to my essay with the thought that American influence on Ambedkar really counted for very little. It is more likely that in those early years in America his own natural proclivities and interests found a healthy soil for growth, and the experience served chiefly to strengthen him in his life-long battle for dignity and equality for his people. The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study. Even today, when Indian students flock to America, their education is generally in the field of technology or science, and they do not enter politics. As far as I have been able to find out, only three men well known in public life have been thoroughly exposed to an American experience: Jay Prakash Narayan; the late Chief Minister of the Punjab, S. Pratap Singh Kairon; and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. An American inevitably wonders what effect his country has had on the lives and thinking of these men. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. Although it was Edwin Seligman, Professor of Economics, with whom Ambedkar kept in touch after he left Columbia and to whom he sent students when he taught at Sydenham college in Bombay, John Dewey seems to have had the greatest influence on him. Dewey\'s pragmatic philosophy, his theories associated with optimistic, pragmatic American democracy, which preached (although it did not always practice) equality, no barriers to upward mobility, the use of machinery to produce leisure, and an attitude of respect for every individual. Ambedkar\'s first political party, the Independent Labour Party founded in 1936, took its name from British politics. But two things lessened the importance of Britain for Ambedkar: the colonial presence of the British in India, and the preference of British liberals for Gandhi and his non-violent direct action campaigns for independence over Ambedkar and the slow parliamentary path. And it also seems likely that American optimism, and the lack of an obvious class system in America, met a natural response in Ambedkar. Ambedkar\'s American contacts did not end when he left Columbia University in June, 1916, although one must admit they became minimal. He continued to correspond with Edwin Seligman, his mentor in Economics at Columbia, and occasionally recommended Indian students to Seligman. In 1930, Ambedkar wrote an article for the Columbia alumni magazine which reveals quite a sentimental attachment: "The best friends I have had in my life were some of my classmates at Columbia and my great professors, John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman and James Harvey Robinson." In 1952, Ambedkar went back to Columbia to receive an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and it is clear that this recognition of his work meant much to him. It was in this period of the early 1950\'s that Ambedkar was publicly critical of India\'s foreign policy of non-alignment, which seemed to him to cut India off from American contacts. I shall end this introduction with two stories, since this is not so much a scholarly tract as an essay which attempts to explore an American-Indian cultural interaction in a personal way. Mrs. Savita Ambedkar tells a touching story of Ambedkar\'s happily imitating John Dewey\'s distinctive classroom mannerisms \x96 thirty years after Ambedkar sat in Dewey\'s classes. It is impossible to find in Ambedkar\'s life story any hint of a guru or a personality which dominated him, but here at least is a suggestion that he was fond of both Dewey the philosopher and Dewey the man. The other story concerns a letter of recommendation written about Ambedkar by Edward Cannon, Professor of Political Economy in the University of London, to the head of Sydenham College, where Ambedkar applied for a teaching position in 1918. Professor Cannon wrote: "I don\'t know anything about Ambedkar except that he came to do a thesis and attacked it and me in a way which showed he had quite extraordinary practical ability.... I rather wonder if he is a pure Indian; his character is rather Scotch-American." There is absolutely no doubt that Ambedkar was pure Indian, and no one who knew his background and the history of his caste would assign any other nationality to him. But this depiction of his character as "Scotch-American" rather delights me. Ambedkar\'s pragmatism, his wide-ranging intellectual interests, his realistic approach to social matters, his uncompromising attitude toward those he felt were his opponents \x96 all these factors make his character and work very understandable to an American. Even his bitterness can be understood by an American who has seen social injustice at work in the midst of American democracy. I am tempted to end this introduction to my essay with the thought that American influence on Ambedkar really counted for very little. It is more likely that in those early years in America his own natural proclivities and interests found a healthy soil for growth, and the experience served chiefly to strengthen him in his life-long battle for dignity and equality for his people. The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study. Even today, when Indian students flock to America, their education is generally in the field of technology or science, and they do not enter politics. As far as I have been able to find out, only three men well known in public life have been thoroughly exposed to an American experience: Jay Prakash Narayan; the late Chief Minister of the Punjab, S. Pratap Singh Kairon; and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. An American inevitably wonders what effect his country has had on the lives and thinking of these men. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S.

The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system.

There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin.

The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings.

In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. Ambedkar\'s first political party, the Independent Labour Party founded in 1936, took its name from British politics. But two things lessened the importance of Britain for Ambedkar: the colonial presence of the British in India, and the preference of British liberals for Gandhi and his non-violent direct action campaigns for independence over Ambedkar and the slow parliamentary path. And it also seems likely that American optimism, and the lack of an obvious class system in America, met a natural response in Ambedkar. Ambedkar\'s American contacts did not end when he left Columbia University in June, 1916, although one must admit they became minimal. He continued to correspond with Edwin Seligman, his mentor in Economics at Columbia, and occasionally recommended Indian students to Seligman. In 1930, Ambedkar wrote an article for the Columbia alumni magazine which reveals quite a sentimental attachment: "The best friends I have had in my life were some of my classmates at Columbia and my great professors, John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman and James Harvey Robinson." In 1952, Ambedkar went back to Columbia to receive an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and it is clear that this recognition of his work meant much to him. It was in this period of the early 1950\'s that Ambedkar was publicly critical of India\'s foreign policy of non-alignment, which seemed to him to cut India off from American contacts. I shall end this introduction with two stories, since this is not so much a scholarly tract as an essay which attempts to explore an American-Indian cultural interaction in a personal way. Mrs. Savita Ambedkar tells a touching story of Ambedkar\'s happily imitating John Dewey\'s distinctive classroom mannerisms \x96 thirty years after Ambedkar sat in Dewey\'s classes. It is impossible to find in Ambedkar\'s life story any hint of a guru or a personality which dominated him, but here at least is a suggestion that he was fond of both Dewey the philosopher and Dewey the man. The other story concerns a letter of recommendation written about Ambedkar by Edward Cannon, Professor of Political Economy in the University of London, to the head of Sydenham College, where Ambedkar applied for a teaching position in 1918. Professor Cannon wrote: "I don\'t know anything about Ambedkar except that he came to do a thesis and attacked it and me in a way which showed he had quite extraordinary practical ability.... I rather wonder if he is a pure Indian; his character is rather Scotch-American." There is absolutely no doubt that Ambedkar was pure Indian, and no one who knew his background and the history of his caste would assign any other nationality to him. But this depiction of his character as "Scotch-American" rather delights me. Ambedkar\'s pragmatism, his wide-ranging intellectual interests, his realistic approach to social matters, his uncompromising attitude toward those he felt were his opponents \x96 all these factors make his character and work very understandable to an American. Even his bitterness can be understood by an American who has seen social injustice at work in the midst of American democracy. I am tempted to end this introduction to my essay with the thought that American influence on Ambedkar really counted for very little. It is more likely that in those early years in America his own natural proclivities and interests found a healthy soil for growth, and the experience served chiefly to strengthen him in his life-long battle for dignity and equality for his people. The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study. Even today, when Indian students flock to America, their education is generally in the field of technology or science, and they do not enter politics. As far as I have been able to find out, only three men well known in public life have been thoroughly exposed to an American experience: Jay Prakash Narayan; the late Chief Minister of the Punjab, S. Pratap Singh Kairon; and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. An American inevitably wonders what effect his country has had on the lives and thinking of these men. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation.

He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. I shall end this introduction with two stories, since this is not so much a scholarly tract as an essay which attempts to explore an American-Indian cultural interaction in a personal way. Mrs. Savita Ambedkar tells a touching story of Ambedkar\'s happily imitating John Dewey\'s distinctive classroom mannerisms \x96 thirty years after Ambedkar sat in Dewey\'s classes. It is impossible to find in Ambedkar\'s life story any hint of a guru or a personality which dominated him, but here at least is a suggestion that he was fond of both Dewey the philosopher and Dewey the man. The other story concerns a letter of recommendation written about Ambedkar by Edward Cannon, Professor of Political Economy in the University of London, to the head of Sydenham College, where Ambedkar applied for a teaching position in 1918. Professor Cannon wrote: "I don\'t know anything about Ambedkar except that he came to do a thesis and attacked it and me in a way which showed he had quite extraordinary practical ability.... I rather wonder if he is a pure Indian; his character is rather Scotch-American." There is absolutely no doubt that Ambedkar was pure Indian, and no one who knew his background and the history of his caste would assign any other nationality to him. But this depiction of his character as "Scotch-American" rather delights me. Ambedkar\'s pragmatism, his wide-ranging intellectual interests, his realistic approach to social matters, his uncompromising attitude toward those he felt were his opponents \x96 all these factors make his character and work very understandable to an American. Even his bitterness can be understood by an American who has seen social injustice at work in the midst of American democracy. I am tempted to end this introduction to my essay with the thought that American influence on Ambedkar really counted for very little. It is more likely that in those early years in America his own natural proclivities and interests found a healthy soil for growth, and the experience served chiefly to strengthen him in his life-long battle for dignity and equality for his people. The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study. Even today, when Indian students flock to America, their education is generally in the field of technology or science, and they do not enter politics. As far as I have been able to find out, only three men well known in public life have been thoroughly exposed to an American experience: Jay Prakash Narayan; the late Chief Minister of the Punjab, S. Pratap Singh Kairon; and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. An American inevitably wonders what effect his country has had on the lives and thinking of these men. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary.

The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study. Even today, when Indian students flock to America, their education is generally in the field of technology or science, and they do not enter politics. As far as I have been able to find out, only three men well known in public life have been thoroughly exposed to an American experience: Jay Prakash Narayan; the late Chief Minister of the Punjab, S. Pratap Singh Kairon; and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. An American inevitably wonders what effect his country has had on the lives and thinking of these men. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study.

There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat.

Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin.

Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society."

In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies.

In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora.

', 'Dr. Ambedkar and America By Prof. Eleanor Zelliot A talk at the Columbia University Ambedkar Centenary, 1991 Introductiory remarks By Prof. Eleanor Zelliot A talk at the Columbia University Ambedkar Centenary, 1991 Introductiory remarks Introductiory remarks Dr. Ambedkar was one of the first (and one of the few) Indian leaders to be educated in the United States. I am not sure what influence his years at Columbia University in New York City had on his life, but I know we can be proud to claim some part of this remarkable man\'s early development. Two of the qualities which mark his life and career \x96 optimism and pragmatism \x96 may have been enhanced by his contact with this country, which prides itself on its charactersitics of hope and practicality. The three years Ambedkar spent at Columbia, 1913-1916, awakened, in his own words, his potential. Columbia was in its golden age, and a list of Ambedkar\'s professors reads like a catalog of early 20th-century American educators. The transcript of Ambedkar\'s work at Columbia reveals that he audited many classes, more than he could have taken for grades, including such subjects as "railroad economics." Later, Ambedkar wrote, "The best friends I have had in my life were some of my classmates at Columbia and my great professors, John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman and James Harvey Robinson. II (Columbia Alumni News, December 19, 1930). Although it was Edwin Seligman, Professor of Economics, with whom Ambedkar kept in touch after he left Columbia and to whom he sent students when he taught at Sydenham college in Bombay, John Dewey seems to have had the greatest influence on him. Dewey\'s pragmatic philosophy, his theories associated with optimistic, pragmatic American democracy, which preached (although it did not always practice) equality, no barriers to upward mobility, the use of machinery to produce leisure, and an attitude of respect for every individual. Ambedkar\'s first political party, the Independent Labour Party founded in 1936, took its name from British politics. But two things lessened the importance of Britain for Ambedkar: the colonial presence of the British in India, and the preference of British liberals for Gandhi and his non-violent direct action campaigns for independence over Ambedkar and the slow parliamentary path. And it also seems likely that American optimism, and the lack of an obvious class system in America, met a natural response in Ambedkar. Ambedkar\'s American contacts did not end when he left Columbia University in June, 1916, although one must admit they became minimal. He continued to correspond with Edwin Seligman, his mentor in Economics at Columbia, and occasionally recommended Indian students to Seligman. In 1930, Ambedkar wrote an article for the Columbia alumni magazine which reveals quite a sentimental attachment: "The best friends I have had in my life were some of my classmates at Columbia and my great professors, John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman and James Harvey Robinson." In 1952, Ambedkar went back to Columbia to receive an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and it is clear that this recognition of his work meant much to him. It was in this period of the early 1950\'s that Ambedkar was publicly critical of India\'s foreign policy of non-alignment, which seemed to him to cut India off from American contacts. I shall end this introduction with two stories, since this is not so much a scholarly tract as an essay which attempts to explore an American-Indian cultural interaction in a personal way. Mrs. Savita Ambedkar tells a touching story of Ambedkar\'s happily imitating John Dewey\'s distinctive classroom mannerisms \x96 thirty years after Ambedkar sat in Dewey\'s classes. It is impossible to find in Ambedkar\'s life story any hint of a guru or a personality which dominated him, but here at least is a suggestion that he was fond of both Dewey the philosopher and Dewey the man. The other story concerns a letter of recommendation written about Ambedkar by Edward Cannon, Professor of Political Economy in the University of London, to the head of Sydenham College, where Ambedkar applied for a teaching position in 1918. Professor Cannon wrote: "I don\'t know anything about Ambedkar except that he came to do a thesis and attacked it and me in a way which showed he had quite extraordinary practical ability.... I rather wonder if he is a pure Indian; his character is rather Scotch-American." There is absolutely no doubt that Ambedkar was pure Indian, and no one who knew his background and the history of his caste would assign any other nationality to him. But this depiction of his character as "Scotch-American" rather delights me. Ambedkar\'s pragmatism, his wide-ranging intellectual interests, his realistic approach to social matters, his uncompromising attitude toward those he felt were his opponents \x96 all these factors make his character and work very understandable to an American. Even his bitterness can be understood by an American who has seen social injustice at work in the midst of American democracy. I am tempted to end this introduction to my essay with the thought that American influence on Ambedkar really counted for very little. It is more likely that in those early years in America his own natural proclivities and interests found a healthy soil for growth, and the experience served chiefly to strengthen him in his life-long battle for dignity and equality for his people. The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study. Even today, when Indian students flock to America, their education is generally in the field of technology or science, and they do not enter politics. As far as I have been able to find out, only three men well known in public life have been thoroughly exposed to an American experience: Jay Prakash Narayan; the late Chief Minister of the Punjab, S. Pratap Singh Kairon; and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. An American inevitably wonders what effect his country has had on the lives and thinking of these men. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. The three years Ambedkar spent at Columbia, 1913-1916, awakened, in his own words, his potential. Columbia was in its golden age, and a list of Ambedkar\'s professors reads like a catalog of early 20th-century American educators. The transcript of Ambedkar\'s work at Columbia reveals that he audited many classes, more than he could have taken for grades, including such subjects as "railroad economics." Later, Ambedkar wrote, "The best friends I have had in my life were some of my classmates at Columbia and my great professors, John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman and James Harvey Robinson. II (Columbia Alumni News, December 19, 1930). Although it was Edwin Seligman, Professor of Economics, with whom Ambedkar kept in touch after he left Columbia and to whom he sent students when he taught at Sydenham college in Bombay, John Dewey seems to have had the greatest influence on him. Dewey\'s pragmatic philosophy, his theories associated with optimistic, pragmatic American democracy, which preached (although it did not always practice) equality, no barriers to upward mobility, the use of machinery to produce leisure, and an attitude of respect for every individual. Ambedkar\'s first political party, the Independent Labour Party founded in 1936, took its name from British politics. But two things lessened the importance of Britain for Ambedkar: the colonial presence of the British in India, and the preference of British liberals for Gandhi and his non-violent direct action campaigns for independence over Ambedkar and the slow parliamentary path. And it also seems likely that American optimism, and the lack of an obvious class system in America, met a natural response in Ambedkar. Ambedkar\'s American contacts did not end when he left Columbia University in June, 1916, although one must admit they became minimal. He continued to correspond with Edwin Seligman, his mentor in Economics at Columbia, and occasionally recommended Indian students to Seligman. In 1930, Ambedkar wrote an article for the Columbia alumni magazine which reveals quite a sentimental attachment: "The best friends I have had in my life were some of my classmates at Columbia and my great professors, John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman and James Harvey Robinson." In 1952, Ambedkar went back to Columbia to receive an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and it is clear that this recognition of his work meant much to him. It was in this period of the early 1950\'s that Ambedkar was publicly critical of India\'s foreign policy of non-alignment, which seemed to him to cut India off from American contacts. I shall end this introduction with two stories, since this is not so much a scholarly tract as an essay which attempts to explore an American-Indian cultural interaction in a personal way. Mrs. Savita Ambedkar tells a touching story of Ambedkar\'s happily imitating John Dewey\'s distinctive classroom mannerisms \x96 thirty years after Ambedkar sat in Dewey\'s classes. It is impossible to find in Ambedkar\'s life story any hint of a guru or a personality which dominated him, but here at least is a suggestion that he was fond of both Dewey the philosopher and Dewey the man. The other story concerns a letter of recommendation written about Ambedkar by Edward Cannon, Professor of Political Economy in the University of London, to the head of Sydenham College, where Ambedkar applied for a teaching position in 1918. Professor Cannon wrote: "I don\'t know anything about Ambedkar except that he came to do a thesis and attacked it and me in a way which showed he had quite extraordinary practical ability.... I rather wonder if he is a pure Indian; his character is rather Scotch-American." There is absolutely no doubt that Ambedkar was pure Indian, and no one who knew his background and the history of his caste would assign any other nationality to him. But this depiction of his character as "Scotch-American" rather delights me. Ambedkar\'s pragmatism, his wide-ranging intellectual interests, his realistic approach to social matters, his uncompromising attitude toward those he felt were his opponents \x96 all these factors make his character and work very understandable to an American. Even his bitterness can be understood by an American who has seen social injustice at work in the midst of American democracy. I am tempted to end this introduction to my essay with the thought that American influence on Ambedkar really counted for very little. It is more likely that in those early years in America his own natural proclivities and interests found a healthy soil for growth, and the experience served chiefly to strengthen him in his life-long battle for dignity and equality for his people. The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study. Even today, when Indian students flock to America, their education is generally in the field of technology or science, and they do not enter politics. As far as I have been able to find out, only three men well known in public life have been thoroughly exposed to an American experience: Jay Prakash Narayan; the late Chief Minister of the Punjab, S. Pratap Singh Kairon; and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. An American inevitably wonders what effect his country has had on the lives and thinking of these men. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. Although it was Edwin Seligman, Professor of Economics, with whom Ambedkar kept in touch after he left Columbia and to whom he sent students when he taught at Sydenham college in Bombay, John Dewey seems to have had the greatest influence on him. Dewey\'s pragmatic philosophy, his theories associated with optimistic, pragmatic American democracy, which preached (although it did not always practice) equality, no barriers to upward mobility, the use of machinery to produce leisure, and an attitude of respect for every individual. Ambedkar\'s first political party, the Independent Labour Party founded in 1936, took its name from British politics. But two things lessened the importance of Britain for Ambedkar: the colonial presence of the British in India, and the preference of British liberals for Gandhi and his non-violent direct action campaigns for independence over Ambedkar and the slow parliamentary path. And it also seems likely that American optimism, and the lack of an obvious class system in America, met a natural response in Ambedkar. Ambedkar\'s American contacts did not end when he left Columbia University in June, 1916, although one must admit they became minimal. He continued to correspond with Edwin Seligman, his mentor in Economics at Columbia, and occasionally recommended Indian students to Seligman. In 1930, Ambedkar wrote an article for the Columbia alumni magazine which reveals quite a sentimental attachment: "The best friends I have had in my life were some of my classmates at Columbia and my great professors, John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman and James Harvey Robinson." In 1952, Ambedkar went back to Columbia to receive an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and it is clear that this recognition of his work meant much to him. It was in this period of the early 1950\'s that Ambedkar was publicly critical of India\'s foreign policy of non-alignment, which seemed to him to cut India off from American contacts. I shall end this introduction with two stories, since this is not so much a scholarly tract as an essay which attempts to explore an American-Indian cultural interaction in a personal way. Mrs. Savita Ambedkar tells a touching story of Ambedkar\'s happily imitating John Dewey\'s distinctive classroom mannerisms \x96 thirty years after Ambedkar sat in Dewey\'s classes. It is impossible to find in Ambedkar\'s life story any hint of a guru or a personality which dominated him, but here at least is a suggestion that he was fond of both Dewey the philosopher and Dewey the man. The other story concerns a letter of recommendation written about Ambedkar by Edward Cannon, Professor of Political Economy in the University of London, to the head of Sydenham College, where Ambedkar applied for a teaching position in 1918. Professor Cannon wrote: "I don\'t know anything about Ambedkar except that he came to do a thesis and attacked it and me in a way which showed he had quite extraordinary practical ability.... I rather wonder if he is a pure Indian; his character is rather Scotch-American." There is absolutely no doubt that Ambedkar was pure Indian, and no one who knew his background and the history of his caste would assign any other nationality to him. But this depiction of his character as "Scotch-American" rather delights me. Ambedkar\'s pragmatism, his wide-ranging intellectual interests, his realistic approach to social matters, his uncompromising attitude toward those he felt were his opponents \x96 all these factors make his character and work very understandable to an American. Even his bitterness can be understood by an American who has seen social injustice at work in the midst of American democracy. I am tempted to end this introduction to my essay with the thought that American influence on Ambedkar really counted for very little. It is more likely that in those early years in America his own natural proclivities and interests found a healthy soil for growth, and the experience served chiefly to strengthen him in his life-long battle for dignity and equality for his people. The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study. Even today, when Indian students flock to America, their education is generally in the field of technology or science, and they do not enter politics. As far as I have been able to find out, only three men well known in public life have been thoroughly exposed to an American experience: Jay Prakash Narayan; the late Chief Minister of the Punjab, S. Pratap Singh Kairon; and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. An American inevitably wonders what effect his country has had on the lives and thinking of these men. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. Ambedkar\'s first political party, the Independent Labour Party founded in 1936, took its name from British politics. But two things lessened the importance of Britain for Ambedkar: the colonial presence of the British in India, and the preference of British liberals for Gandhi and his non-violent direct action campaigns for independence over Ambedkar and the slow parliamentary path. And it also seems likely that American optimism, and the lack of an obvious class system in America, met a natural response in Ambedkar.

It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. Ambedkar\'s American contacts did not end when he left Columbia University in June, 1916, although one must admit they became minimal. He continued to correspond with Edwin Seligman, his mentor in Economics at Columbia, and occasionally recommended Indian students to Seligman. In 1930, Ambedkar wrote an article for the Columbia alumni magazine which reveals quite a sentimental attachment: "The best friends I have had in my life were some of my classmates at Columbia and my great professors, John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman and James Harvey Robinson." In 1952, Ambedkar went back to Columbia to receive an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and it is clear that this recognition of his work meant much to him. It was in this period of the early 1950\'s that Ambedkar was publicly critical of India\'s foreign policy of non-alignment, which seemed to him to cut India off from American contacts. I shall end this introduction with two stories, since this is not so much a scholarly tract as an essay which attempts to explore an American-Indian cultural interaction in a personal way. Mrs. Savita Ambedkar tells a touching story of Ambedkar\'s happily imitating John Dewey\'s distinctive classroom mannerisms \x96 thirty years after Ambedkar sat in Dewey\'s classes. It is impossible to find in Ambedkar\'s life story any hint of a guru or a personality which dominated him, but here at least is a suggestion that he was fond of both Dewey the philosopher and Dewey the man. The other story concerns a letter of recommendation written about Ambedkar by Edward Cannon, Professor of Political Economy in the University of London, to the head of Sydenham College, where Ambedkar applied for a teaching position in 1918. Professor Cannon wrote: "I don\'t know anything about Ambedkar except that he came to do a thesis and attacked it and me in a way which showed he had quite extraordinary practical ability.... I rather wonder if he is a pure Indian; his character is rather Scotch-American." There is absolutely no doubt that Ambedkar was pure Indian, and no one who knew his background and the history of his caste would assign any other nationality to him. But this depiction of his character as "Scotch-American" rather delights me. Ambedkar\'s pragmatism, his wide-ranging intellectual interests, his realistic approach to social matters, his uncompromising attitude toward those he felt were his opponents \x96 all these factors make his character and work very understandable to an American. Even his bitterness can be understood by an American who has seen social injustice at work in the midst of American democracy. I am tempted to end this introduction to my essay with the thought that American influence on Ambedkar really counted for very little. It is more likely that in those early years in America his own natural proclivities and interests found a healthy soil for growth, and the experience served chiefly to strengthen him in his life-long battle for dignity and equality for his people. The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study. Even today, when Indian students flock to America, their education is generally in the field of technology or science, and they do not enter politics. As far as I have been able to find out, only three men well known in public life have been thoroughly exposed to an American experience: Jay Prakash Narayan; the late Chief Minister of the Punjab, S. Pratap Singh Kairon; and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. An American inevitably wonders what effect his country has had on the lives and thinking of these men. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy.

The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. The other story concerns a letter of recommendation written about Ambedkar by Edward Cannon, Professor of Political Economy in the University of London, to the head of Sydenham College, where Ambedkar applied for a teaching position in 1918. Professor Cannon wrote: "I don\'t know anything about Ambedkar except that he came to do a thesis and attacked it and me in a way which showed he had quite extraordinary practical ability.... I rather wonder if he is a pure Indian; his character is rather Scotch-American." There is absolutely no doubt that Ambedkar was pure Indian, and no one who knew his background and the history of his caste would assign any other nationality to him. But this depiction of his character as "Scotch-American" rather delights me. Ambedkar\'s pragmatism, his wide-ranging intellectual interests, his realistic approach to social matters, his uncompromising attitude toward those he felt were his opponents \x96 all these factors make his character and work very understandable to an American. Even his bitterness can be understood by an American who has seen social injustice at work in the midst of American democracy. I am tempted to end this introduction to my essay with the thought that American influence on Ambedkar really counted for very little. It is more likely that in those early years in America his own natural proclivities and interests found a healthy soil for growth, and the experience served chiefly to strengthen him in his life-long battle for dignity and equality for his people. The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study. Even today, when Indian students flock to America, their education is generally in the field of technology or science, and they do not enter politics. As far as I have been able to find out, only three men well known in public life have been thoroughly exposed to an American experience: Jay Prakash Narayan; the late Chief Minister of the Punjab, S. Pratap Singh Kairon; and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. An American inevitably wonders what effect his country has had on the lives and thinking of these men. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University.

Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. The American Experience of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Very few of India\'s leaders have been educated in America. In the British period, England and to a lesser extent France and Germany were the focal points for overseas study. Even today, when Indian students flock to America, their education is generally in the field of technology or science, and they do not enter politics. As far as I have been able to find out, only three men well known in public life have been thoroughly exposed to an American experience: Jay Prakash Narayan; the late Chief Minister of the Punjab, S. Pratap Singh Kairon; and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. An American inevitably wonders what effect his country has had on the lives and thinking of these men. It is clear that J. P. Narayan\'s direct contact with Amecican poverty during the Depression era and with American radical thinkers somewhat influenced the development of his socialist attitudes. It is possible that Kairon learned some of his expertise with mass politics from his interval in America. In the case of Dr. Ambedkar, the influence seems to be chiefly in developing his commitment to a pragmatic, flexible democratic system. Ambedkar spent the years from 1913 to 1916 at Columbia University in New York City. There is little material on his political thought from the pre-1913 period with which to compare his post-1916 writings, but even so I would like to suggest that the American experience did influence the thought and action of this unusually gifted and innovative son of Bharat. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis.

Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. B.R. Ambedkar entered the Graduate School of Columbia University in 1913 after graduating from Elphinstone College in Bombay. His patron was Sayajirao Gaikwad, Maharajah of Baroda. The Gaikwad was distinguished for his financial support of reform measures and had already assisted Ambedkar in securing his college education. Whose idea it was that Ambedkar should go to America is not clear. The Gaikwad was certainly amenable to sanctioning a stipend for Ambedkar\'s study in America through the Baroda state Education Department. However, Ambedkar was 23 at the time and he seems to have been intellectually mature, with his interests already established. From the time of Jotiba Phule, there has been a sense of appreciation among the leaders of the Non-Brahman Movement for America\'s effort to create an egalitarian democracy. Ambedkar was aware of this, and it is quite possible that he himself made the decision to go to America. As a student at Columbia, Ambedkar explored as widely as possible the economic and social aspects of American development. He took an enormous number of courses ranging from the economics of American railways to American history, auditing what he could not take for credit. He seems to have exposed himself to as many of the top-ranking professors at Columbia as he could, whatever their field. Columbia at this time was in its Golden Age, and the list of men with whom Ambedkar studied represents a catalog of important early-20th-century American thinkers. John Dewey, James Shotwell, Edwin Seligman, James Harvey Robinson, Franklin Giddings, and Alexander Goldenweiser were all men of great importance in the development of American thought, and probably nowhere else could Ambedkar have received such a broad and deep exposure to an optimistic, expansive, pragmatic body of knowledge. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity.

Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar\'s own original research at Columbia was concerned with Indian themes. In his primary field of economics, under the guidance of Edwin Seligman, he wrote a dissertation for his Ph.D. on The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India (published in 1925 by P.S. King and Company, London). His thesis was critical of the imperial British system and its harmful effect on Indian development. The other major publication coming out of the Columbia experience was a paper on "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development," given first in a seminar in Anthropology with Alexander Goldenweiser and published in May, 1917, in The Indian Antiquary. Both studies make it clear that although Ambedkar was gaining all he could from his educational opportunity in America, his attention was centered on using that knowledge to analyse the Indian situation. Ambedkar\'s paper on caste was not a diatribe against the iniquities of the caste system but rather an effort to present a theory of the development of the system. His two main points are significant. First, there was a basic, unified Indian culture. He wrote, "Ethnically all peoples are heterogeneous. It is the unity of culture that is the basis of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture." Second, he denied that caste stratification arose through racial, color-related, or occupational factors. He stated that the caste system grew through a process by which other groups imitated the endogamy of the Brahman priest caste. There is no development of a theory of untouchability in the paper; that was to come late in Ambedkar\'s life. These two premises, however, remained constant in his thought. His later theory of the development of untouchability and his work for the eradication of untouchability were based on these theories, i.e. that Indian culture was basically unified and basically valuable, and that caste inequalities were a social development without a racial origin. It is difficult to say what effect the study of anthropology and sociology under Goldenweiser and others at Columbia had on Ambedkar. Certainly he felt such systematic study of society was valuable, for he instituted a Department of Sociology at Siddharth College in a day when Sociology was not usually offered in Indian colleges. Also, the sociological vocabulary lingered, and perhaps some of the concepts behind the American jargon. Shortly after returning from his study abroad, Ambedkar testifed to the Southborough Committee on Franchise, the group which was preparing the election procedure for the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms instituted in 1921. Ambedkar\'s lengthy testimony before this body stressed the lack of "endosmosis" or "like-mindedness" between Touchable and Untouchable \x96 phrases evidently borrowed from American social analysis. Ambedkar\'s solution was to educate and politicize the disadvantaged group into full use of popular assemblies so that the new political institutions would not continue the "hardships and disabilities entailed by the social system." Ambedkar may have observed the ethnic groups in New York, the Irish, Italians and Jews, gaining political power through unified political pressure. The early-20th-century American dream of social and political equality in the great melting pot was apparent in both academic circles and actual New York life during Ambedkar\'s time at Columbia University. Both Ambedkar\'s study and experience would have encouraged him to look beneath cultural differences for a basic national cultural unity and to look to the political process as the way in which different groups attained their proper place on the national scene. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy.

Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India. His stance was basically socialist, but he did not align himself with any socialist party except for specific election alliances. He admired a number of the economic measures taken by the Soviet Union to reform their economy, and at one time advocated state control of the land. But he also harshly criticized the political system of the Soviet Union, and he was not a Marxist. The theory that history was the result of economic forces held little meaning for him. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician." He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. A direct comparison between the Negroes of America and the Untouchables of India does not appear in Ambedkar\'s writings. This is natural, since Ambedkar denied that there was a racial basis for untouchability. In contrast to the leaders of almost all other Untouchable movements, he refused to claim that Untouchables were "Adi-Dravida," (the first Dravidians), or "Ad-Dharm," (the first religion, i.e. pre-Aryan), but stressed that they were of the same racial background as other Indians. His observation of the obvious racial differences between Negro and white Americans and the segregation based on race in America may have heightened his belief that the Untouchables\' way to equality lay in asking for political and educational privilege because of social discrimination, not because of a separate racial background. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the American situation was quite sophisticated. Jotiba Phule, as early as 1873, had dedicated his book Gulamgiri (slavery) to "the good people of the united States...for their sublime disinterested and self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of Negro Slavery." But Ambedkar noted the political expediency of Lincoln\'s action in freeing the slaves. In his criticism of Mahatma Gandhi in What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (2nd edition published by Thacker and Company in 1942), he compared Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, stating that both were concerned with freeing the depressed groups in their countries for the political reason of preserving national unity. This view of Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation now has currency among American Blacks, who no longer view the freeing of the slaves as "disinterested and self-sacrificing." Although Ambedkar did.not identify with the American Negro in words, he understood their position well enough to anticipate their criticism of Lincoln. Ambedkar\'s understanding of the reformer as politician was based on bitter experience, but it also reflects his grasp of comparative history. He did not borrow wholesale from the American experience, but he used his knowledge of American culture to analyze his own country\'s social situation. Although the study of economics was Ambedkar\'s major interest in both the United States and in London, there was little scope for him to take action in his field in his public life in India.

He actually was far more statesman than politician, and I have felt at times that he could not pay enough attention to organization, to detail. As a statesman, however, his idealism, his vision, was mixed with a down-to-earth pragmatism that is the mark of any successful movement. As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene. When I look at the new thrusts of India\'s Scheduled Castes \x96 the commitment of many to an ethical and inclusive Buddhism; the urge to write poetry and fiction and drama that communicates on a high literary plane to all men; the efforts, however ineffective they may seem at this time; to play a real role in politics; this effort of those who live in America to show commitment and concern for their homeland \x96 and when I see how much of this pride and hope and dynamic can be traced back to Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud to honor the memory of a very great man. If Ambedkar had succeeded in becoming head of the Planning Commission (and it is probable that this was his wish), he might have developed some of his socialist ideas within the context of democracy. His chief economic measures, however, were limited to those taken while he was Member for Labour in the Viceroy\'s Executive Council in the years before Independence. While holding the Labour Portfolio, he instituted a Tripartite Labour Conference to consider such matters as a Joint Labour Management committee and an Employment Exchange, and he attempted to institute social security measures for industrial workers. In these matters, both American and British policies offered some guide lines. It is in the basis of Ambedkar\'s politics that American influence seems strongest. Behind all of Ambedkar\'s seeming separatism \x96 separate political parties for the backward classes, special reservation of seats in political assemblies and in government jobs \x96 there was a strong, unwavering belief in the power of democratic institutions to bring about social equality. India\'s case might demand special techniques not found in the West, but Ambedkar\'s basic faith was in representative political bodies. It is too much to say that Ambedkar\'s American experience created this belief, but it is clear that it strengthened it. John Dewey\'s thought especially was meaningful to Ambedkar, for it offered encouragement that educated and politically aware peoples could work out their own political destiny in a pragmatic way, pruning the useless and preserving the useful in their societies. In his Annihilation of Caste Ambedkar quotes John Dewey, "who was my teacher, and to whom I owe so much": "Every society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively perverse. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future society." Direct references are few, but as late as 1954, Ambedkar wrote to a Scheduled Caste student then in London, asking him to go to the British Museum and copy out Dewey\'s book on democracy, then out of print, for use in an essay on democracy. All his life Dr. Ambedkar worked to further the education of the deprived. Not only was his achievement in terms of numbers of institutions great, but those institutions were innovative in a way that John Dewey would have approved. Siddharth College, founded in Bombay, was a "morning college" which allowed poor students to go to classes before their daily work. And it stressed a student parliament, which allowed untold numbers of students to experience all the intricacies and methods of parlimentary democracy in a mock version of national politics. Dr. Ambedkar College at Aurangabad was founded in an area that had no educational institution at the higher level other than a teacher training college. It offered not only Liberal Arts, but also Law and Commerce in an area totally deprived of any such opportunity, and I have been told that Dr. Ambedkar\'s wish was to add a department of Fine Arts so that Marathwada would not only have educational opportunity but a chance to develop the aesthetics of the long-dead but rich creative past revealed in the marvellously carved caves of Ajanta and Elora. Another life-long belief of Dr. Ambedkar\'s may have been reinforced by his contact with John Dewey and his observation of the American scene. Dr. Ambedkar held the most optimistic possible faith in the power of democracy. In spite of the difficulty of welding adherents who constituted a small minority into an effective political party, in spite of the flaws in the democratic process he must have observed on the American scene, he never seems to have even considered a Communist structure or any sort of authoritarian government a possible cure for India\'s ills. His belief that people could be educated into change, that total participation of all elements of society in the political process was essential, that parliamentary democracy was the only conceivable way for India to progress, seems to have been unshakable. In my opinion, his constant support of the democratic system greater strengthened India\'s commitment to this path. There are other traces of American thought in Dr. Ambedkar\'s philosophy. One that seems to me to be exceptionally important is his position on India\'s cultural and ethnic unity. His first writing on this appears in the paper he wrote for a year-long seminar in Anthropology with Columbia Professor Alexander Goldenweiser, that was later published in The Indian Antiquary for May, 1917, under the title "Castes in India, Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development." In this paper, as we noted above, he denied that color or occupation had determined caste; he was very clear that India had a remarkably deep cultural unity, and that caste divisions were not created by "the conscious command of a Supreme Authority," but by "an unconscious growth in the life of a human society under peculiar circumstances." It should be remembered that in the 1920\'s, when Dr. Ambedkar began his work, there were several movements among the Depressed Classes to separate themselves from "Aryans." A movement in the North was called Adi-Dharm (original religion), and one in the South was called "Adi-Dravida" (original Dravidians). Dr. Ambedkar\'s insistence on cultural unity overcame this thrust for separatism. He referred to religious ideas to support this idea, not to the works of Manu but to the idea of Brahman, the universal divine principle, which he felt should have produced the most egalitarian society on earth. Dr. Ambedkar carried this idea of cultural unity into action when he founded his schools, his reform organizations and his political parties \x96 not a single one was ever limited to his own caste or bore his caste name, and only one was expressly for Scheduled Castes, and that for purely political purposes. From the beginning, anyone in need, anyone with concern, could be a participant. From the beginning, any special treatment was seen as temporary, as a way to raise the standards of the deprived group so that it could participate on an equal basis. In this matter of cultural unity, it may be that America\'s influence was due to its own problems, its own separatism. Dr. Ambedkar must have observed the racial discrimination in America, and determined that India must avoid any such permanent separation. Here again, it seems to me that his stres on unity has contributed greatly to India\'s ideal of cultural integration. I have mentioned practicality and pragmatism, but I do not mean to imply by these terms that Dr. Ambedkar was a "practical politician."

As an example, he put aside some of his visionary ideas (government ownership of land, for instance) in order to help India create a viable, widely accepted Constitution. Anyone who reads his "draft constitution" written in the late 1940\'s, and then traces his leadership of the process of writing a constitution and notes the final result, will be struck by the difference in what he first thought was right and what he finally approved as India\'s need at that time. I have talked to Scheduled Caste leaders who felt Dr. Ambedkar was too much of a statesman, not enough of a politician. My own feeling is that leadership of his calibre is still needed, that his combination of vision and pragmatism will influence India\'s direction long after the current generation has left the scene.

Ambedkar was studying at the Columbia University in 1920 when economist Edwin R Seligman wrote to Professor Herbert Foxwell, teaching at London School of Economics (LSE), asking him to help Ambedkar with his research. "I find he has already taken his doctor\'s degree and has only come here to finish a research. I had forgotten this. I am sorry we cannot identify him with the School but there are no more worlds here for him to conquer," Foxwell wrote to LSE secretary Mrs Mair soon after. The Dalit leader\'s student days in London were marked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last November when he opened a museum at his former home in north London.\xa0Ambedkar went on to register for a master\'s degree and completed a PhD thesis at LSE. The year 2016 also marks the centenary of his first visit to LSE in 1916, the LSE said in its release. "In 1916, he registered at LSE for a master\'s degree and took courses in Geography with Halford Mackinder, and Political Ideas with G Lowes Dickinson, alongside Social Evolution and Social Theory with Professor L T Hobhouse. The fees for the course were 10 pounds 10 shillings.\xa0At the same time, Ambedkar enrolled for the bar course at Gray\'s Inn," the LSE documents show. Ambedkar\'s studies were interrupted as he was recalled to India to serve as Military Secretary in Baroda and in July 1917 the University of London gave him leave of absence of up to four years. In 1920, Ambedkar returned to LSE after working as professor of political economy at Sydenham College in Mumbai and giving evidence to the Scarborough Committee preparing the 1919 Government of India Act on the position and representation of "untouchable" communities. Initially, he applied to complete his masters degree and wrote a thesis on \'The Provincial Decentralisation of Imperial Finance in India\'. "There was a slight glitch in his LSE career in April 1921 when he failed to send in his form for the summer examinations and the School Secretary, Mrs Mair, had to write to University of London\'s Academic Registrar for permission to submit the form late," the LSE records. Ambedkar finally submitted his doctoral thesis, \'The Problem of the Rupee\', in March 1923 but it was not recommended for acceptance and reports claim that the thesis was too revolutionary and anti-British for the examiners. However, there is no indication of this in Ambedkar\'s student file. The thesis was resubmitted in August 1923 and accepted in November 1923.\xa0After his success in academics, Ambedkar returned to India where he was prominent in the campaign for Indian independence and opposing discrimination against Dalit communities. On August 29, 1947, the iconic leader was appointed Chairman of the Constitution\'s \'Drafting Committee\'.\xa0He was awarded \'Bharat Ratna\', India\'s highest civilian award, in 1990. He died in 1956 at the age of 65. ©2018 Diligent Media Corporation Ltd.', "No eBook availablemdppl.comRediff BooksFlipkartInfibeamFind in a libraryAll sellers\xa0» 1 ReviewWrite reviewDalit Movement in India and Its Leaders, 1857-1956By Rāmacandra Kshīrasāgara About this bookShop for Books on Google PlayBrowse the world's largest eBookstore and start reading today on the web, tablet, phone, or ereader.Go to Google Play Now »Pages displayed by permission of M.D. Publications Pvt.

शिक्षित थे, अतः उनकी सेवा करने के लिए बाध्य थे। उन्हें महाराजा गायकवाड़ का सैन्य सचिव नियुक्त किया गया, लेकिन जातिगत भेदभाव के कारण कुछ ही समय में उन्हें यह नौकरी छोड़नी पडी। उन्होंने इस घटना को अपनी आत्मकथा, वेटिंग फॉर अ वीजा में वर्णित किया। इसके बाद, उन्होंने अपने बढ़ते परिवार के लिए जीविका साधन खोजने के पुनः प्रयास किये, जिसके लिये उन्होंने लेखाकार के रूप में, व एक निजी शिक्षक के रूप में भी काम किया, और एक निवेश परामर्श व्यवसाय की स्थापना की, किन्तु ये सभी प्रयास तब विफल हो गये जब उनके ग्राहकों ने जाना कि ये अछूत हैं। 1918 में, ये मुंबई में सिडेनहम कॉलेज ऑफ कॉमर्स एंड इकोनॉमिक्स में राजनीतिक अर्थशास्त्र के प्रोफेसर बने। हालांकि वे छात्रों के साथ सफल रहे, फिर भी अन्य प्रोफेसरों ने उनके साथ पानी पीने के बर्तन साझा करने पर विरोध किया। भारत सरकार अधिनियम १९१९, तैयार कर रही साउथबरो समिति के समक्ष, भारत के एक प्रमुख विद्वान के तौर पर आम्बेडकर को साक्ष्य देने के लिये आमंत्रित किया गया। इस सुनवाई के दौरान, आम्बेडकर ने दलितों और अन्य धार्मिक समुदायों के लिये पृथक निर्वाचिका और आरक्षण देने की वकालत की। १९२० में, बंबई से, उन्होंने साप्ताहिक मूकनायक के प्रकाशन की शुरूआत की। यह प्रकाशन शीघ्र ही पाठकों मे लोकप्रिय हो गया, तब आम्बेडकर ने इसका प्रयोग रूढ़िवादी हिंदू राजनेताओं व जातीय भेदभाव से लड़ने के प्रति भारतीय राजनैतिक समुदाय की अनिच्छा की आलोचना करने के लिये किया। उनके दलित वर्ग के एक सम्मेलन के दौरान दिये गये भाषण ने कोल्हापुर राज्य के स्थानीय शासक शाहू चतुर्थ को बहुत प्रभावित किया, जिनका आम्बेडकर के साथ भोजन करना रूढ़िवादी समाज मे हलचल मचा गया। बॉम्बे उच्च न्यायालय में विधि का अभ्यास करते हुए, उन्होंने अछूतों की शिक्षा को बढ़ावा देने और उन्हें ऊपर उठाने के प्रयास किये। उनका पहला संगठित प्रयास केंद्रीय संस्थान बहिष्कृत हितकारिणी सभा की स्थापना था, जिसका उद्देश्य शिक्षा और सामाजिक-आर्थिक सुधार को बढ़ावा देने के साथ ही अवसादग्रस्त वर्गों के रूप में सन्दर्भित "बहिष्कार" के कल्याण करना था। दलित अधिकारों की रक्षा के लिए, उन्होंने मूकनायक, बहिष्कृत भारत, समता, प्रबुद्ध भारत और जनता जैसी पांच पत्रिकाएं निकालीं। सन १९२५ में, उन्हें बम्बई प्रेसीडेंसी समिति में सभी यूरोपीय सदस्यों वाले साइमन कमीशन में काम करने के लिए नियुक्त किया गया। इस आयोग के विरोध में भारत भर में विरोध प्रदर्शन हुये। जहां इसकी रिपोर्ट को अधिकतर भारतीयों द्वारा अनदेखा कर दिया गया, आम्बेडकर ने अलग से भविष्य के संवैधानिक सुधारों के लिये सिफारिश लिखकर भेजीं। thumb|right|300px|\'जयस्तंभ\', कोरेगाँव भिमा में डॉ॰ बाबासाहब आम्बेडकर एवं उनके अनुयायि, 1 जनवरी 1927 द्वितीय आंग्ल-मराठा युद्ध के अन्तर्गत १ जनवरी 1818 को हुई कोरेगाँव की लड़ाई के दौरान मारे गये भारतीय महार सैनिकों के सम्मान में आम्बेडकर ने 1 जनवरी 1927 को कोरेगाँव विजय स्मारक (जयस्तंभ) में एक समारोह आयोजित किया। यहाँ महार समुदाय से संबंधित सैनिकों के नाम संगमरमर के एक शिलालेख पर खुदवाये गये तथा कोरेगाँव को दलित स्वाभिमान का प्रतीक बनाया। सन १९२७ तक, डॉ॰ आम्बेडकर ने छुआछूत के विरुद्ध एक व्यापक एवं सक्रिय आंदोलन आरम्भ करने का निर्णय किया। उन्होंने सार्वजनिक आंदोलनों, सत्याग्रहों और जलूसों के द्वारा, पेयजल के सार्वजनिक संसाधन समाज के सभी वर्गों के लिये खुलवाने के साथ ही उन्होनें अछूतों को भी हिंदू मन्दिरों में प्रवेश करने का अधिकार दिलाने के लिये संघर्ष किया। उन्होंने महाड शहर में अछूत समुदाय को भी नगर की चवदार जलाशय से पानी लेने का अधिकार दिलाने कि लिये सत्याग्रह चलाया। 1927 के अंत में सम्मेलन में, आम्बेडकर ने जाति भेदभाव और "छुआछूत" को वैचारिक रूप से न्यायसंगत बनाने के लिए, प्राचीन हिंदू पाठ, मनुस्मृति, जिसके कई पद, खुलकर जातीय भेदभाव व जातिवाद का समर्थन करते हैं, की सार्वजनिक रूप से निंदा की, और उन्होंने औपचारिक रूप से प्राचीन पाठ की प्रतियां जलाईं। 25 दिसंबर 1927 को, उन्होंने हजारों अनुयायियों के नेतृत्व में मनुस्मृति की प्रतियों को जलाया। इसकी स्मृति में प्रतिवर्ष 25 दिसंबर को मनुस्मृति दहन दिवस के रूप में आम्बेडकरवादियों और हिंदू दलितों द्वारा मनाया जाता है। 1930 में, आम्बेडकर ने तीन महीने की तैयारी के बाद कालाराम मन्दिर सत्याग्रह आरम्भ किया। कालाराम मन्दिर आंदोलन में लगभग १५,००० स्वयंसेवक इकट्ठे हुए, जिससे नाशिक की सबसे बड़ी प्रक्रियाएं हुईं। जुलूस का नेतृत्व एक सैन्य बैंड ने किया था, स्काउट्स का एक बैच, महिलाएं और पुरुष पहली बार भगवान को देखने के लिए अनुशासन, आदेश और दृढ़ संकल्प में चले गए थे। जब वे द्वार तक पहुँचे, तो द्वार ब्राह्मण अधिकारियों द्वारा बंद कर दिए गए।', 'references': ['इमेज स्रोत, DEEKSHABHOOMI भारत के सबसे बड़े नेताओं में से एक और दलितों के सबसे बड़े नेता डॉक्टर भीमराव अंबेडकर ने कहा था "छुआछूत गुलामी से भी बदतर है". भारत में दलित (जिन्हें पहले अछूत कहा जाता था) सबसे ख़राब स्थितियों में जीते हैं क्योंकि हिंदुओं की जाति व्यवस्था उन्हें समाज में सबसे निचले स्थान पर रखती है. हालांकि हिंदुओं में छुआछूत के बहुत सारे प्रमाण हैं और इस पर बहुत चर्चा भी हुई है लेकिन भारत के मुसलमानों के बीच छुआछूत पर बमुश्किल ही बात की गई है. इसकी एक वजह तो यह है कि इस्लाम में जाति नहीं है और यह समानता और समतावाद को बढ़ावा देता है. भारत के 14 करोड़ मुसलमानों में से ज़्यादातर स्थानीय हैं जिन्होंने धर्मपरिवर्तन किया है. अधिकतर ने हिंदू उच्च-जातियों के उत्पीड़न से बचने के लिए इस्लाम ग्रहण किया. समाप्त सामाजिक रूप से पिछड़े मुसलमानों के एक संगठन के प्रतिनिधि एजाज़ अली के अनुसार वर्तमान भारतीय मुसलमान की 75 फ़ीसदी दलित आबादी इन्हीं की है जिन्हें दलित मुसलमान कहा जाता है. इमेज स्रोत, AFP इस विषय पर काम करने वाले राजनीति विज्ञानी डॉक्टर आफ़ताब आलम कहते हैं, "भारत और दक्षिण एशिया में रहने वाले मुसलमानों के लिए जाति और छुआ-छूत जीवन की एक सच्चाई है." अध्ययनों से पता चलता है कि "छुआछूत इस समुदाय का सबसे ज़्यादा छुपाया गया रहस्य है. शुद्धता और अशुद्धता का विचार; साफ़ और गंदी जातियां" मुसलमानों के बीच मौजूद हैं. अली अलवर की एक किताब के अनुसार हिंदुओं में दलितों को अस्पृश्य कहा जाता है तो मुसलमान उन्हें अर्ज़ाल (ओछा) कहते हैं. डॉक्टर आलम के साल 2009 में किए एक अध्ययन के अनुसार किसी भी प्रमुख मुस्लिम संगठन में एक भी \'दलित मुसलमान\' नहीं था और इन सब पर \'उच्च जाति\' के मुसलमानों ही प्रभावी थे. अब कुछ शोधकर्ताओं के समूह के किए अपनी तरह के पहले बड़े अध्ययन से पता चला है कि भारतीय मुसलमानों के बीच भी छुआछूत का अभिशाप मौजूद है. प्रशांत के त्रिवेदी, श्रीनिवास गोली, फ़ाहिमुद्दीन और सुरेंद्र कुमार ने अक्टूबर 2014 से अप्रैल 2015 के बीच उत्तर प्रदेश के 14 ज़िलों के 7,000 से ज़्यादा घरों का सर्वेक्षण किया. इमेज स्रोत, AP उनके अध्ययन के कुछ निष्कर्ष इस प्रकार हैः • \'दलित मुसलमानों\' के एक बड़े हिस्से का कहना है कि उन्हें गैर-दलितों की ओर से शादियों की दावत में निमंत्रण नहीं मिलता. यह संभवतः उनके सामाजिक रूप से अलग-थलग रखे जाने के इतिहास की वजह से है. • \'दलित मुसलमानों\' के एक समूह ने कहा कि उन्हें गैर-दलितों की दावतो में अलग बैठाया जाता है. इसी संख्या के एक और समूह ने कहा कि वह लोग उच्च-जाति के लोगों के खा लेने के बाद ही खाते हैं. बहुत से लोगों ने यह भी कहा कि उन्हें अलग थाली में खाना दिया जाता है. • करीब 8 फ़ीसदी \'दलित मुसलमानों\' ने कहा कि उनके बच्चों को कक्षा में और खाने के दौरान अलग पंक्तियों में बैठाया जाता है. • कम से कम एक तिहाई ने कहा कि उन्हें उच्च जाति के कब्रिस्तानों में अपने मुर्दे नहीं दफ़नाने दिए जाते. वह या तो उन्हें अलग जगह दफ़नाते हैं या फिर मुख्य कब्रिस्तान के एक कोने में. • ज़्यादातर मुसलमान एक ही मस्जिद में नमाज़ पढ़ते हैं लेकिन कुछ जगहों पर \'दलित मुसलमानों\' को महसूस होता है कि मुख्य मस्जिद में उनसे भेदभाव होता है. इमेज स्रोत, Reuters • \'दलित मुसलमानों\' के एक उल्लेखनीय तबके ने कहा कि उन्हें ऐसा महसूस होता है कि उनके समुदाय को छोटे काम करने वाला समझा जाता है. • \'दलित मुसलमानों\' से जब उच्च जाति के हिंदू और मुसलमानों के घरों के अंदर अपने अनुभव साझा करने को कहा गया तो करीब 13 फ़ीसदी ने कहा कि उन्हें उच्च जाति के मुसलमानों के घरों में अलग बर्तनों में खाना/पानी दिया गया. उच्च जाति के हिंदू घरों की तुलना में यह अनुपात करीब 46 फ़ीसदी है. • इसी तरह करीब 20 फ़ीसदी प्रतिभागियों को लगा कि उच्च जाति के मुसलमान उनसे दूरी बनाकर रखते हैं और 25 फ़ीसदी \'दलित मुसलमानों\' के साथ को उच्च जाति के हिंदुओं ने ऐसा बर्ताव किया. • जिन गैर-दलित मुसलमानों से बात की गई उनमें से करीब 27 फ़ीसदी की आबादी में कोई \'दलित मुसलमान\' परिवार नहीं रहता था. • 20 फ़ीसदी ने दलित मुसलमानों के साथ किसी तरह की सामाजिक संबंध होने से इनकार किया. और जो लोग \'दलित मुसलमानों\' के घर जाते भी हैं उनमें से 20 फ़ीसदी उनके घरों में बैठते नहीं और 27 फ़ीसदी उनकी दी खाने की कोई चीज़ ग्रहण नहीं करते. इमेज स्रोत, AFP • गैर-दलित मुसलमानों से पूछा गया था कि वह जब कोई दलित मुसलमान उनके घर आता है तो क्या होता है. इस पर 20 फ़ीसदी ने कहा कि कोई \'दलित मुसलमान\' उनके घर नहीं आता. और जिनके घऱ \'दलित मुसलमान\' आते भी हैं उनमें से कम से कम एक तिहाई ने कहा कि \'दलित मुसलमानों\' को उन बर्तनों में खाना नहीं दिया जाता जिन्हें वह आमतौर पर इस्तेमाल करते हैं. भारत में जाति के आधार पर भेदभाव सभी धार्मिक समुदायों में मौजूद है- सिखों में भी. पारसी ही शायद अपवाद हैं. प्रशांत के त्रिवेदी कहते हैं, "आमतौर पर माना जाता है कि जाति एक हिंदू अवधारणा है क्योंकि जाति को हिंदुओं के धर्मग्रंथों से ही मान्यता मिलती है. यह औपनिवेशिक काल से सरकारों और विद्वानों की सोच पर प्रभावी रही है." अन्य शोधार्थियों के साथ उनका मानना है कि दलित मुसलमानों और ईसाइयों को हिंदू दलितों की तरह फ़ायदे मिलने चाहिएं. इससे सबक यह मिलता है कि भारत में भले ही आप जाति छोड़ दें लेकिन जाति आपको नहीं छोड़ती.

B.R. Ambedkar was a central figure in the struggle for Indian independence, the architect of the new nation\'s constitution, and the foremost champion of the civil rights of the "untouchable" class to which he belonged. He spoke and wrote ceaselessly on behalf of "untouchables," but his passion for justice was wide-ranging; in 1950 he resigned from his position as the country\'s first Minister of Law when Nehru\'s cabinet refused to pass the Women\'s Rights Bill. Ambedkar’s conversion to Buddhism, near the end of his life, helped to spark a revival of a new form of Buddhism in India. His actions and writings have been essential in empowering Dalits with dignity, self-respect, social consciousness, political identity, and the motivation to fight for their basic human rights. Highly revered as a father-figure to Dalits—he is respectfully referred to as “Babasaheb”—Ambedkar’s life and work are a constant inspiration to the Dalit Movement and provide the foremost example of the courageous spirit and initiative needed for Dalits to bring about social justice and to “cast out caste.” Bhim Ram Ambedkar was born into the “untouchable” Mahar caste on April 14th, 1891, in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh. As a child, at school he was seated on the floor in a corner of the classroom, separate from other students, and his teachers refused to touch him or his notebooks because of his supposed “impurity.” Despite such daily caste humiliation and discrimination, Ambedkar excelled in his studies. He passed his high school matriculation examination in Bombay in 1907 and became one of the first ‘untouchables’ ever to attend college in India, studying at Bombay University and Elfinstone College. After graduating with his BA in 1912, Ambedkar received a scholarship to study in the United States from the Maharaja of Baroda (in exchange for 10 years of future service to the State). At Columbia University in New York City, he experienced social equality (the absence of caste discrimination) for the first time. There he studied under John Dewey, who inspired many of his ideas about human rights and social justice. Ambedkar earned his MA in Political Science from Columbia in 1915 and then traveled to England to study at the London School of Economics (LSE) and Gray’s Inn (Law School). In 1917, after only one year in the UK, his scholarship was terminated and he was called back to India. Returning to work as Military Secretary for Baroda state, Ambedkar was distressed by the sudden reappearance of discrimination in his life. In early 1920, he began publishing the news weekly Mooknayak (Leader of Fools) in which he criticized orthodox Hindu politicians and the seeming reluctance of the Indian political community to fight caste discrimination. Later in the same year, having accumulated the necessary funds, he returned to London where he completed his DSc from LSE and earned his Bar-at-Law degree from Gray’s Inn. Upon completing his education abroad, Ambedkar returned to Bombay as a barrister, established a successful legal practice and, in 1924, founded the Bahishkrit Hitkarini Sabha (Association for the Depressed Classes) to promote the spread of education among the socially and politically downtrodden, to improve their economic status, and to provide a voice for their grievances. Between 1927 and 1932, Ambedkar led a series of nonviolent campaigns to assert the right of “Untouchables” to draw water from public tanks & wells and to enter Hindu places of worship. Especially important was the satyagraha (nonviolent civil disobedience) he led in Mahad where tens of thousands of “Untouchables” protested successfully for their right to use water from the public Chowdar Tank, which had been traditionally prohibited to them (though animals were allowed to use the water!). In a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar public condemned the classic Hindu text, the Manusmrti (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying the system of caste discrimination and “untouchability,” ceremonially burning copies of the ancient text. Increasingly unpopular with dominant caste Hindus, Ambedkar became even more so due to his insistence on the need for separate electorates for the depressed classes. When the British granted this demand, Gandhi, who felt strongly that this would divide society in future generations and prevent the political and social unity of Hindus, went on a fast until death in protest of the decision. Under massive pressure, in 1932 Ambedkar joined with Gandhi in signing the Pune Pact, in which the demand for separate elections was dropped and replaced with special concessions like reserved seats for “Untouchables” in legislative assemblies. Over time, Ambedkar became increasingly critical of orthodox Hinduism, which he saw as inextricably linked to caste discrimination, and at the Yeola Conversion Conference in 1935, he stated famously, “I was born as a Hindu but will not die as a Hindu;” and exhorted his followers to leave Hinduism and join another religion. Ambedkar was also fiercely critical of certain aspects and practices of Islam, especially child marriage, the mistreatment of women, and narrow literalist interpretations of Islamic doctrine which prevented positive social reform within Muslim society. In 1936, Ambedkar founded the Independent Labour Party and in 1942 he founded the Scheduled Caste Federation for the independent political assertion of Dalits. Between 1941 and 1945 Ambedkar published a large number of controversial books and pamphlets which included criticisms of Hindu civilization, Gandhi and the Congress Party, and the Muslim League’s demand for a separate state of Pakistan. In 1947 India achieved independence and Prime Minister Nehru appointed Ambedkar the Minister of Law. Despite his unpopularity and criticisms, Ambedkar was also appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee for the Constitution of India and played the central role in its crafting. In February 1948 he presented the Draft Constitution and it was adopted in November 1949 with all its 356 articles, including Article 11 which explicitly abolishes “untouchability” in all forms.After resigning from the Cabinet in 1951, Ambedkar increasingly turned his attention towards Buddhism. He began writing a book, The Buddha and His Dhamma—published a year after his death and today often considered his magnum opus—which articulated his understanding of the Buddha’s message and its contemporary relevance. On 14 October 1956, in a formal public ceremony (which explicitly rejected and condemned Hinduism), Ambedkar converted to Buddhism along with over 300,000 followers. This action sparked an ongoing Buddhist revival in India and a number mass conversions of Dalits to Buddhism have occurred since then. Bhim Raj Ambedkar died on 6 December 1956. In 1990, he was posthumously honored with India’s highest national award, “Bharat Ratna” and his portrait was adorned in the Central Hall of Parliament. His birth date is now a public holiday in India known as Ambedkar Jayanti.

कोरेगांव में मराठों और महारों के बीच हुआ क्या था इमेज स्रोत, Getty Images ज़ाहिर है इसे एक सकारात्मक प्रतीक के रूप में देखना चाहिए. महार समाज बिल्कुल ग़रीब है. उसे आज भी न्याय नहीं मिल रहा. पेशवा के निरंकुश राज को भला कोई कैसे भूल सकता है. उस राज में दलित अछूत थे. इस अछूत समाज में अगर चेतना पैदा करनी है, अस्मिता पैदा करनी है तो कोई भी अच्छा नेता स्वाभिमान जगाने के लिए एक प्रतीक खड़ा करेगा. यह प्रतीक इतिहास में होगा, ऐतिहासिक होगा. आंबेडकर ने उसी प्रतीक को खड़ा कर चेतना को झकझोड़ा. ये महज़ लड़ाई की बात नहीं है. इस लड़ाई के बाद विश्व युद्ध हुआ था. पहले विश्व युद्ध के बाद ब्रिटिश आर्मी में महारों की भर्ती बंद कर दी गई थी. बाबा साहेब आंबेडकर के पिता रामजी आंबेडकर आर्मी में थे. ब्रिटिश आर्मी में महारों की भर्ती फिर से शुरू कराने के लिए लोगों ने अभियान चलाया. इस अभियान के तहत लोग ब्रिटिश अधिकारियों के पास ज्ञापन लेकर गए थे और इसमें रामजी आंबेडकर भी शामिल थे. ब्लॉग: क्या जिग्नेश जैसे नेता हिंदुत्व की राजनीति के लिए ख़तरा हैं?

सारा इतिहास क्या सवर्ण ही लिखेंगे? बाबा साहेब के जाने के बाद भी यह यात्रा बंद नहीं हुई थी. 2014 के आम चुनाव में बहुत सारे दलितों ने मोदी को वोट किया था. भीमा-कोरेगांव में दलितों से जुड़ा इतना बड़ा प्रतीक है वहां मोदी क्यों नहीं गए? मुख्यमंत्री फडणवीस वहां क्यों नहीं गए? अगर समाज दलित स्वाभिमान को स्वीकार करता तो वहां हमले नहीं होते. लोग इसमें पहचान की राजनीति की बात कह रहे हैं. लेकिन यह भी सच है कि पहचान की राजनीति हमेशा ग़लत नहीं होती है. अगर आप सकारात्मक प्रतीक के साथ पहचान की राजनीति करते हैं तो उसका फ़ायदा ही मिलता है. पिछले 50-60 सालों में दलितों में आरक्षण के ज़रिए एक किस्म की चेतना आई है. इनके बीच एक मध्य वर्ग तैयार हुआ है. इनके पास पैसे आए हैं. कोरेगांव में हुई हिंसा का 'आंखों-देखा' हाल 'दलितों को केवल मोहरा बना रहे हैं संगठन' इमेज स्रोत, Getty Images पर दलित सांस्कृतिक पहचान की उपेक्षा क्यों करेंगे? वो संस्कृति और इतिहास में भी अपने हिस्से की तलाश कर रहे हैं. यह बिल्कुल ही सकारात्मक अस्मिता की राजनीति है. इतने दशकों बाद भी दलितों को अपना हक़ नहीं मिला है. डॉक्टर राममनोहर लोहिया कहते थे कि अगर दलितों को उनका हक़ देना है तो सवर्णों को मानना होगा कि उन्होंने अन्याय किया है. आज लोग सड़क पर क्यों हैं? इसलिए हैं कि आरक्षण रद्द करने की बात कही जा रही है. संविधान बदलने की बात कही जा रही है. इसका संदेश क्या जाता है? इसे भारतीय जनता पार्टी ने भी हवा दी है. इन्हीं सारे विवादों के दौरान बीजेपी सांसद ने संविधान बदलने की बात कही थी. आरएसएस वाले कभी-कभी आरक्षण बंद करने की बात करते हैं. बंद के दौरान ऐसे थमा मुंबई का चक्का महाराष्ट्र बंद: बस और ट्रेन सेवा पर असर कोरेगांव भीमा में हिंसा के पीछे वजह क्या है? इन आंदोलनों की पृष्ठभूमि में ऐसे बयानों की भी भूमिका है. महाराष्ट्र में बौद्ध नौ फ़ीसदी हैं. ब्राह्मणों के बाद सबसे ज़्यादा पढ़ा-लिखा समुदाय बौद्धों का है. ये बौद्ध पहले महार ही थे. इन महारों ने आंबेडकर के साथ ही अपना धर्म बदला था. पढ़े-लिखे होने के बावजूद इन्हें जो सम्मान मिलना चाहिए था वो मिला नहीं. इस धर्मांतरण से दलितों के बीच बड़ा बदलाव आया है. इस आंदोलन से बीजेपी और शिव सेना में डर है. पहले महाराष्ट्र में दलितों की रिपब्लिकन पार्टी थी. रिपब्लिकन पार्टी में विभाजन हुआ और अठावले ने अलग पार्टी बना ली. दलितों को साथ लिए बिना किसी भी पार्टी की राजनीति आगे नहीं जा सकती है. इस बात को हर पार्टी जानती है. महाराष्ट्र की हर पार्टी में दलित हैं. दलितों में बौद्ध नौ फ़ीसदी हैं और ग़ैरबौद्ध भी बड़ी संख्या में हैं. महाराष्ट्र में दलित कम से कम 15 से 16 फ़ीसदी हैं. अगर दलित भड़कते हैं तो शिव सेना और बीजेपी के लिए इनसे वोट लेना आसान नहीं होगा. 2014 के आम चुनाव में दलितों ने कांग्रेस और एनसीपी के ख़िलाफ़ वोटिंग की थी. कोरेगांव: संभाजी भिडे पर क्या बोले थे मोदी? 'दलित हूं, बिज़नेस क्लास में चलता हूं' कोरेगांव में भड़की हिंसा के बाद क्या हुआ? बीजेपी में एक समूह ऐसा भी है जो चाहता था कि भिमा-कोरेगांव जाना चाहिए. कुछ अतिवादियों से इस हमले को कराया गया है. इसमें मराठा युवकों को भड़काया गया. ध्रुवीकरण की कोशिश की गई. अगर ये मराठा बनाम दलित हो जाता तो पूरे महाराष्ट्र में ध्रुवीकरण होता. ज़ाहिर है इसका फ़ायदा बीजेपी को मिलता. पिछले तीन सालों में महाराष्ट्र सरकार ने कुछ काम नहीं किया है. ऐसे में बीजेपी के लिए इस तरह का ध्रुवीकरण उसके हक़ में होगा. किसान भड़के हुए हैं. मराठा आरक्षण मांग रहे हैं. ये बिल्कुल सोची-समझी राजनीति है. महाराष्ट्र में पेशवा घराने का कोई मतलब नहीं है. पेशवा राज में जो दूसरा बाजीराव था वो बहुत ही निरंकुश शासक था. जब वो ब्रिटिश राज में हारा तो महाराष्ट्र छोड़कर कर्नाटक भाग गया था. महाराष्ट्र में पेशवा को लेकर कोई प्रतिष्ठा जैसी बात नहीं है. महाराष्ट्र में पेशवाई आ गई मतलब अत्याचार आ गया है माना जाता है. पेशवाई का मतलब अत्याचार से है.

", ' Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar An iconic reformer who gave new lease of life to the dalit and underprivileged by abolishing untouchability and slavery through education, organization, agitation and advocacy of Dhammachakra If a leader is to be judged by the length of the period s(he) continues to influence, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is a leader whose thoughts continue to be relevant even today. His ideas on equality, brotherhood, democracy, independence, international economics and politics are valid even in present times, and his work continues to be effective and inspiring to many. Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was born in Mhow (Madhya Pradesh) in 1891. As a child he went through many scarring experiences caused by the social inequality that prevailed in those times among the masses. Later, in 1913, when he went to America on a scholarship given by the Maharaja of Baroda, Sayajirao Gaikwad, he did not experience untouchability. These two contradictory experiences - one in his own country and the other in a foreign land, motivated him to free his countrymen from untouchability. He completed his doctorate from Columbia University in 1925, after submitting his thesis titled the National Dividend of India – A Historical and Analytical Study. He studied sociology, economics and politics at the Columbia University. He went on to present the thesis The Problem of the Rupee at the London University and was presented with the DSc degree. After coming back to India, he started four newspapers in order to present before the society the problems faced by the untouchables. These newspapers were: Mooknayak (Mute Hero - 1920), Bahishkrut Bharat (India Ostracized - 1927), Janata (Masses - 1930) and Prabudhha Bharat (An Awakened India - 1956). The newspapers in circulation at that time in Maharashtra did not present the problems of the untouchables. There was a definite need for a separate newspaper for the untouchables. These newspapers covered social, political and cultural developments in the country, but Babasaheb also wrote about a new asocial order. He never used the newspapers for propagating his political party, but used them instead to provoke the upper castes and the so-called untouchables to think about this social order. It was not only through his newspapers that he wrote on this topic, but he also published books like The Untouchables, Shudra purviche kon hote (Who were the Shudras?) and Bhuddha and His Dhamma. He also wrote a book on international politics titled Thoughts on Pakistan. Not only was he a social critic but also an excellent literary critic. He never used literature as a means of entertainment. Babasaheb has not only appreciated the language of Saint Tukaram, Saint Dnyaneshwar and Mukteshwar, but has also written comprehensive critiques on plays like Khara Brahman (The Real Brahmin) by Prabodhankar Thackeray and Dakkhan cha diva (The Light of Deccan) by Yashwant Tipnis. Dr. Ambedkar has commented upon Bertrand Russell’s play Principles of Social Reconstruction. He is the author of the books Riddles in Hinduism, Maharashtra as a Linguistic State, Status and Minorities and Bharatatil Jaati (Castes in India). Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was influenced by the personalities, work and ideas of Saint Kabir, Mahatma Phule and Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj. Saint Kabir and Mahatma Phule were his most revered teachers. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar was an action-oriented reformer. He strongly believed that all men are equal and that there are no higher or lower castes. He disliked the hierarchical caste system, the four-fold caste categorization and the oppression of the so-called lower castes. He taught equality to his family members first. When he returned to India from London, Babasaheb’s family felt that he should go home in a car but Babasaheb refused. Then they insisted that he travel in the first class compartment of the train. But this too he declined. He travelled in the third class compartment of the train with all his family members. On reaching home, his brother offered him a chair, but Babasaheb preferred to sit on the floor. Thus, he set an example of equality for his family members. His education had reformed him, yet he never forgot his roots. In 1927, Dr. Ambedkar organised the Satyagraha at Mahad in Raigad district to allow the untouchables access to the water from the Chavdar lake. In 1930, he initiated another Satyagraha to enable the untouchables to enter the Kalaram temple at Nashik. He himself was a non-believer; however, he believed that the denial of temple entry to the dalit was an important aspect of untouchability, and if this was addressed, then the issue would be largely resolved. Both the Satyagraha were symbolic and represented the fight of the untouchables for equal human rights and their right to live life with dignity. They also served to instil confidence among the dalit. To stress this point, he publicly burnt copies of Manusmriti, an ancient scripture that advocated the four-fold caste system among Hindus. Between the years 1917 to 1935, he undertook many efforts to abolish untouchability. However, he realized that these efforts were not bearing fruit. The people from the so-called higher castes made no efforts to change their way of thinking. Therefore, in 1935 at Yevala, he publicly declared that although he was born as a Hindu, he would not die as one. In 1956, along with five lakh untouchables, he converted to Buddhism (14th October 1956, Nagpur). Dr Ambedkar was not only fighting against the caste system or for the upliftment of the Dalit society but also for the Indian freedom struggle. He paid attention to the education, status of women, superstition, economy and the political administration of the country. Between the years from 1930 to 1932, he fought for the rights of the Dalit at the Round Table Conference. He also put forth a Hindu Code Bill for the social status, divorce rights and property rights of Hindu women in the parliament. When this Bill was rejected, he resigned as a Member of Parliament. Dr. Ambedkar thought deeply on the point of debate between Tilak and Agarkar about whether political independence should precede social development or vice versa. He realized that if the freedom of the Dalit would not have any value in the post-independent India, then the situation would become even more complicated. To avoid this, he undertook the task of abolishing untouchability. During the Round Table Conference in 1930, even when he represented the British in the Conference, he advised the British to leave India. In his PhD thesis too, he analyzed the economic oppression of Indians by the British. When Mahatma Gandhi undertook a fast until death on the question of separate constituencies, Dr. Ambedkar was torn between the importance of Gandhiji’s life and the betterment of the Dalit. He was forced to agree to a compromise. Gandhiji broke his fast and Ambedkar established a reserved constituency for the Dalit (Pune Pact). Before converting to Buddhism, he studied the teachings of all religions and chose Buddhism as it advocated non-violence, truth and human rights. The act of converting too highlights his patriotism. Dr. Ambedkar, who in his school days used to study for over 18 hours every day, was well aware of the importance of education. In order to propagate education, he established the Peoples’ Education Society and the Depressed Class Education Society. Apart from the field of education, he established the Bahishkrut Hitkarni Sabha (Society for the welfare of the ostracized) in the field of politics. In 1927, he established the Samata Sainik Dal (a troupe to ensure equality and harmony) in order to protect the Dalit from the higher castes. In 1936, he established an independent Labour Party and in 1942, the All India Scheduled Caste Federation. He also wanted to establish a Republican Party at an all-India level but unfortunately he passed away before he could do so. In 1946, he also established Siddhartha College at Mumbai and in 1950, Milind College at Aurangabad. Dr. Ambedkar also understood agriculture and farming. He was an advocate for collective farming. He was of the opinion that an uninterrupted supply of water and electricity would help a predominantly agricultural country like India to flourish in no time. Dr. Ambedkar created laws to abolish the Khoti system, a system of contractual farming that was exploitative to the farmers. Dr. Ambedkar believed that just as the railway routes were owned by the central government, likewise the water routes should also be owned by the central government. His opinion was however disregarded and as a result, all water routes today remain insecure. Today, the river-linking project is being discussed, a project that Dr. Ambedkar had proposed way back then. In 1947, Dr. Ambedkar became a member of Pandit Nehru’s cabinet. The same year, he was selected the first Law Minister of independent India. The Constituent Assembly also elected him a member of the Constitution drafting committee, which appointed him the Chairman of the committee. India will forever remember Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar as the Father of the Indian Constitution. He stressed the importance of having a strong central government in a country of diverse States. Had it not been strong, then India could hardly have been able to proudly proclaim Unity in Diversity. In most western countries, the women and poor in the country were given the right to vote very late. Dr. Ambedkar however ensured that India granted the right to vote to every adult immediately after Independence, thus laying the foundations of a strong democracy. He also made provisions in the Constitution for the service rules and appointments of civil servants, thus allowing them to serve fearlessly and independently. Dr. Ambedkar, known as the Father of the Indian Constitution and the patron of the Dalit, passed away on 6th December 1956. Today, the Indian democracy is facing a challenge. It appears that the Indian population is bent on denying democracy. Dr. Ambedkar used to say, “Until the British ruled India, we could hold them responsible for all consequences, good or bad. After Independence however, the onus rests with us and we must behave more responsibly”. In order to strengthen the democracy, Dr. Ambedkar opposed giving undue importance to the individual. Today however, idolisation of individuals is common. Today, Dr. Ambedkar is proclaimed the hero of only select castes when in reality, his thoughts spanned a much broader canvas. The democracy that he upheld is being ridiculed today. Hence, it is imperative that his thoughts on democracy are referred again in today’s context. An unparalleled intellect, his own efforts to complete higher education, worldly wisdom, rebellious and reformist attitude, organisational skills, discipline and neatness, excellent oratory skills and superb control over English language, voracious reading, research, studious and motivational writing – all these qualities helped transform Bhimji Ramji Ambedkar to the MahaManav (human being par excellence) Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar who abolished the thousands of years old slavery of dalit in India.

(2) मशीनों का प्रयोग संभव बनाने के लिए छोटी जोत के बजाय बड़े खेतों पर खेती की जानी चाहिए. इमेज स्रोत, Other डॉक्टर आंबेडकर अमरीका से समझौता भी करना चाहते थे, अमरीकियों को ग़लत और सही बताने के लिए नहीं बल्कि उनसे सीखने के लिए, पैसा और तकनीक उधार लेने के लिए. क्या संघ परिवार इस मुद्दे पर आंबेडकर का समर्थन करेगा? संघ के जगत गुरु के दावे का क्या होगा? जैसा कि लेख के शुरू में कहा गया था उसे दोहराते हुए- भारत की दक्षिणपंथी शाखा डॉक्टर आंबेडकर और दलितों को भी स्वीकार करने को तैयार हो रही है तो यह स्वागतयोग्य है. कहा तो यह जाता है कि हम किसी विचारधारा से संचालित नहीं हो सकते, हम ऐसी किसी विचारधारा का अपमान नहीं कर सकते जिससे हम सहमत नहीं लेकिन बाबा साहेब आंबेडकर, दलितों का सफलतापूर्क समर्थन करने के लिए संघ को खुद में खुली भावना लानी होगी, हाथ में लाल गुलाब लेकर बदलते भारत का स्वागत करना होगा. इमेज स्रोत, GOOGLE क्योंकि जो बदलाव का विरोध कर रहे हैं वह डॉक्टर आंबेडकर का विरोध कर रहे हैं और साथ ही एक प्रेरक विचार के रूप में भारत का भी.

(2) मशीनों का प्रयोग संभव बनाने के लिए छोटी जोत के बजाय बड़े खेतों पर खेती की जानी चाहिए. डॉक्टर आंबेडकर अमरीका से समझौता भी करना चाहते थे, अमरीकियों को ग़लत और सही बताने के लिए नहीं बल्कि उनसे सीखने के लिए, पैसा और तकनीक उधार लेने के लिए. क्या संघ परिवार इस मुद्दे पर आंबेडकर का समर्थन करेगा? संघ के जगत गुरु के दावे का क्या होगा? जैसा कि लेख के शुरू में कहा गया था उसे दोहराते हुए- भारत की दक्षिणपंथी शाखा डॉक्टर आंबेडकर और दलितों को भी स्वीकार करने को तैयार हो रही है तो यह स्वागतयोग्य है. कहा तो यह जाता है कि हम किसी विचारधारा से संचालित नहीं हो सकते, हम ऐसी किसी विचारधारा का अपमान नहीं कर सकते जिससे हम सहमत नहीं लेकिन बाबा साहेब आंबेडकर, दलितों का सफलतापूर्क समर्थन करने के लिए संघ को खुद में खुली भावना लानी होगी, हाथ में लाल गुलाब लेकर बदलते भारत का स्वागत करना होगा. क्योंकि जो बदलाव का विरोध कर रहे हैं वह डॉक्टर आंबेडकर का विरोध कर रहे हैं और साथ ही एक प्रेरक विचार के रूप में भारत का भी.

What stands out however is Ambedkar’s awareness of that religious phantasm that goes by the name of Manu: disembodied, invisible and deathless, a figure that lives on, impossible to exorcise. This spectral thinking of sacredness and authority, this consciousness of force as such, makes its first appearance in Ambedkar’s Masters thesis at Columbia University. Within it is arranged the young Ambedkar’s formidable ethical and political itinerary that is still to come. The strange possession by spirit in New York perhaps also explains why it is not Ambedkar’s favourite Edmund Burke, whose Reflections on the Revolution in France appears in Ambedkar’s corpus somewhat later, but instead William Shakespeare’s Macbeth that establishes the young Ambedkar’s moral and political procedures. At the end of the opening section of his thesis, after having detailed the corrupt procedures of the East India Company’s Court of Directors by which the Company has come to secure its political sovereignty over India, Ambedkar comes up with this exemplary theatrical allegory. “The last chapter must have made it clear how and why Western Europe was at a death grapple for the control of India. We followed the armies of the different leaders of different nations—fighting for a country the people of which had very little to choose in the final destiny—the Cama, the Albuquerques, the Busseys, the Lallys, the Clives, the Malcolms, the lakes and the shores as though enacting the train of ghosts of Banquo’s line all that terrified Shakespeare’s Macbeth out of his senses.” This is an intriguing formulation and for someone like Ambedkar who is the master of pithy prose, exemplary for the conjuring gesture it makes. This might be, in fact, another Ambedkar altogether, whose own conceptual and mystical rhythm we must now, more than ever, follow with care. For Ambedkar, Gandhi’s ahimsa, built on the forced disarming of the unequal, merely regulated sacrifice in the name of dharma. For, Ambedkar’s early resort to Shakespeare marks not merely his formidable rhetorical resources. Instead, his frequent resort to theatre over four decades exemplifies his ability to see moral and political force as constitutively braided with the mystical history of representation. It exemplifies his ability to apprehend imperial and religious violence as founded in the economy of aura and luminosity. It exemplifies, above all, his suspicion of the very concept of representation, including his suspicion of parliamentary democracy itself. Ambedkar will never let go of democracy, nor will he ever renounce religion as such. But he will never forget that the worst violence, the violence that always returns in the alliance between religion and democracy, occurs precisely when they promise to keep life safe and sacred. Of course, there is a distinctive history of this suspicion; a long genealogy of this Shudra-Shakespearean willingness to see religion as a scene whose staged aura corrupts life at its very source. For, Ambedkar’s militant master Jyotirao Govindrao Phule too will have seen at work in the modern colonised Brahmin the grey shades of Shakespeare’s Othello. “The Brahmin of the present time,” Phule writes in Gulamgiri, “finds to some extent, like Othello, that his occupation is gone. But knowing full well this state of matters, is the Brahmin inclined to make atonement for his past selfishness?” It’s as if Ambedkar, in invoking Macbeth half a century later, is answering the master’s Shakespearean question. Note his pointed accent on the people who had “very little to choose in the final destiny”. These are the multitude that have had little choice and have been rendered mook. Devoid of speech and representation, they are spoken for only by ventriloquists, by conjurers of divinity whose own authority lies shrouded in religious secrecy. If the long line of European conquerors chases the dream of domination over India, the Brahmin ventriloquists who claim to speak for India do not resist. Instead, they look away, hiding behind their own gods and spirits, scared as they are, like Macbeth, “out of their senses”. Macbeth always knew that the guilt lay with him. Deep down, he knew of the evil and violence he harboured within himself. And the Empire, like Banquo’s apparition, is the reminder of that guilt: the violence at the very source of religion, the corruption at the very heart of Hinduism, that has now returned to haunt the Macbeth-like Brahmins. As if Shakespeare, read in haste, has prepared Ambedkar for ghosts, as if Empire and Manusmriti share some duplicitous force, as if their auras are derived from the same source, as if they are merely ghosts of one another that must be exorcised together. For, barely a year later, still in New York, Ambedkar turns his gaze to the sovereign figure of Indic jurisprudence. Invoking chaturvarnya and its ghostly author, he announces, “I first propose to handle the law-giver of India. Every country has its law-giver, who arises as an incarnation (avatar) in times of emergency to set right a sinning humanity and give it the laws of justice and morality. Manu, the lawgiver of India, if he did exist, was certainly an audacious person.” It is three months after Ambedkar’s essay is published that Gandhi—unaware of this corpus taking form in New York—speaks of the Shudra’s disarmament as the very foundation of ahimsa. “Everyone cannot bear arms here,” he says, curiously instituting Shudradharma as the ethical ground of satyagraha. Where Ambedkar insists on handling the ghost of Manu—and handling, touching, wielding, manual strength, the hand as such are not here merely metaphors for the untouchable, they are also questions of ability and right—Gandhi perversely hinges the very possibility of ahimsaic civility on the historic amputation of the Shudra’s hand. For Ambedkar, Gandhi’s ahimsa, founded on the forced demilitarisation of the unequal, is not non-violent enough. It doesn’t give love; it instead merely regulates sacrifice in the name of epochal duty (Yugadharma). In the decades to come, Ambedkar’s task will be impossible: the task not merely of the annihilation (ucched) of chaturvarnya, but the task instead of thinking up another civility (vinaya) in the midst of that annihilation, the task of annihilation as ahimsa. In 1940, he will, intriguingly, term this task the “love of politics”. Clearly, a political love, a democratic love of hands, numbers, and counting, demands not only civility but also force—militancy even. As Ambedkar affirms some months before his death, “Ahimsa does not say ‘Don’t Kill’. It only says ‘Love all’.” A very paradoxical and sacrificial love then, an ahimsa still to come, yet one that Ambedkar presses on us more urgently than ever. Aishwary Kumar is assistant professor of intellectual history and political theory at Stanford University in California, USA Thank you to all those who have taken the trouble to read the article and share their thoughts. Out of the arguments made here, there are two that perhaps need answering. So here they go. 1. The first part of the article compares outcomes (relative percentages of population of the religions concerned) irrespective of the process that led to those outcomes - whether immigration, relatively faster population growth or conversions. This was for two reasons. One, to put the figure of 2.3 per cent in "numerical perspective", as the article itself explained. The second reason was that outcomes are ultimately what the crux of debate is about. The rest of the article in any case dealt with process - or conversions in this case, from both a contemporary and historical perspective. 2. Some commenters have tried to cast doubts on the reliability of Census 2001. Those who do this should bear in mind that Census 2001 was conducted by a BJP government. Considering the extreme importance that BJP gives to this issue, it would be reasonable to expect that IF it had perceived a problem with the methodology that was distorting the numbers, it would have fixed it. As the article mentioned, BJP or BJP-supported governments have been in power for 10 of the last 40 years, or about a quarter of the time, and the only reasonable conclusion one can arrive at is that any misreporting of numbers, real or perceived, would be marginal and hence, not of importance. To all other arguments made, my answer is the following: Please read the article again, with particular focus on the quotations of Vivekananda and Monier Williams, and the history of the missionary efforts in Bengal and their outcome. Are u guys blind to the political realities of the present, and the near future. Guys (upper castes); your days are over, and whether you like it or not, despite your best attempts to get the mainstream parties led by Brahmin/upper caste leaders to resort to “caste calculations” to come to power in 2014, the prospect of a non-Congress & non-BJP Third front, a combine of regional parties, mostly caste based is almost certain. Brahmins have been applying the “law of contradictions” (read Mao- Tse-Tung) to play one caste against the other in every part of India to see that their illegally usurped properties and privileges are not lost, when Babasaheb’s constitution brought parliamentary democracy throwing the Brahmins into dog house. Earlier, they thought that after gaining independence from the British, they could take over and lord over the country again. But Babasaheb’s constitution struck the first nail on the Brahminical coffin. Different state govts. passed into the hands of non-Brahmins. Since about eight years, even the Union Govt. is going out of their hands because caste and region -based parties have ousted all “national” (read Brahmin) parties like the Congress, BJP, CPI-CPM etc. The coming parliamentary election will see the final death of all “national” parties and the Govt. of India will be captured by caste and regional parties. This is the prediction of not just several surveys, but also senior leaders of BJP, and Congress. And if that outcome is foiled by corrupt, manipulative, exploitative, cunning political leaders from the upper caste (namely Brahmins), then get ready to bear the burnt of a total revolution, and a bloody one. BTW Shyamal Barua, despite Ambdekar\'s strenuous efforts (and success) in bringing Dalits of out of poverty and ignorance, I see you still miss the shithole you came from; thus your constant reference to it. You can still retire and go back to wherever you came from - someone more deserving can fill your place. Shyamal Barua, It is sad, but what is even sadder is that despite your supposed education, you choose to generalize that all upper castes are the same. Shows that there\'s a huge difference between being literate and being educated. Which is why I\'m not such a huge fan of reservations. The idiots get the jobs while the deserving continue to rot. @Whatever,Alakshyendra,Fedup,Vasant,Aaditya,Shankar,Sandilya,Irreverent, Ramki et al. >> Does this piece of news widen up your chest with pride, or shame? http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Wrong-number-call-rings-social-boycott-of-50-dalit-families/articleshow/15552449.cms Pathetic high caste Hindus! Still so actively carrying out the legacy of inhumanity for thousands of years! Still couldn\'t come out to the light from their dark SHlT HOLE! @ WHATEVER, Bangalore >> Now that the article been removed from homepage, no point in continuing the debate (sic. rant) in this column, but enjoyed your posts, including your labelling me as a "frog in the well\', which I take it as a compliment; and going by your familiarity with Bengali vocabulary and pastimes, I have a feeling that you cud be a Bengali or non-Bengali Brahmin, who had been a resident of Kolkata. Keep up the good job of helping poor students from the upper caste; lest they may self-immolate themselve like young Rajiv Goswami in protest against report of Mandal commission; tut..tut..feel sorry for him; for he couldn\'t survive the effect of even 30 yrs of token reservation post 1953, when the dalits have braved 100% reservation for upper castes, not to talk about the severe atrocities they were subjected to for over 3000 years, since the days of Manu.

Ambedkar's passion for the abolition of untouchability and the eradication of caste is as relevant today as it was 75 years ago. THE HINDU ARCHIVES B.R. Ambedkar. He suggested inter-caste marriage as the remedy to destroy caste. THE Jat Pat Todak Mandal, a social reformist organisation of Lahore, had, in 1936, invited Dr B.R. Ambedkar to deliver the presidential address of its annual conference on the topic of the caste system in India. Ambedkar sent the manuscript of his speech titled The Annihilation of Caste. However, the organising committee found some of his views, particularly his critique of the Vedas and his inclination to leave the Hindu fold, unacceptable. It, therefore, suggested to Ambedkar that he delete these views, to which he replied that “he would not change a comma”. The speech thus remained undelivered. Ambedkar subsequently published it in May 1936. Among the numerous writings and speeches of Ambedkar that run into thousands of pages, The Annihilation of Caste is indeed his magnum opus. Judged by any criterion such as content, logic, argument, language, diction, exposition, urge and, above all, the force, it is a manifesto of social emancipation, and occupies a place similar to what The Communist Manifesto once did in the world communist movement. Since the book is polemical in nature, Ambedkar did not elaborate much on the agonies, indignities, humiliation and overall sufferings of the Sudras, and particularly the untouchables. He only gave illustrations of how they were deprived of education and freedom of occupation and were subjected to stigmatised manual labour, all resulting in their virtual economic slavery, how they were segregated and deprived of basic rights such as drinking water even from public wells, and above all how they were made victims of social persecutions. But, according to Ambedkar, worse and unparalleled, the Hindu Dharmashastras gave legitimacy to the doctrine of Chaturvanya and the caste system. The infamous Manusmriti dehumanised the Sudras and untouchables, ruled the Hindu psyche for centuries and created the greatest obstacle to any serious attempt at eradicating the caste system. This made Ambedkar publically burn the Manusmriti on the occasion of his historical Mahad Satyagraha in 1927 for establishing the right of untouchables to drink the water of the Chawdar tank in Mahad town in Maharashtra. In The Annihilation of Caste, Ambedkar, probably for the first time, raised many profound questions with respect to caste. First, he rejected the defence of caste on the basis of division of labour and argued that it was not merely a division of labour but a division of labourers. The former was voluntary and depended upon one's choice and aptitude and, therefore, rewarded efficiency. The latter was involuntary, forced, killed initiative and resulted in job aversion and inefficiency. He argued that caste could not be defended on the basis of purity of blood, though pollution is a hallmark of the caste system. He quoted from D.R. Bhandarkar's paper “Foreign Elements in the Hindu Population” that “there is hardly any class or caste in India which has not a foreign strain in it, (and that) there is an admixture of alien blood not only among the warrior classes – the Rajputs and the Marathas – but also among the Brahmins who are under the happy delusion that they are free from all foreign elements.” Ambedkar thus argued that caste had no scientific basis. He painfully maintained that Hindu society was a collection of castes, fixed in watertight compartments with graded hierarchy that made an associated corporate life virtually impossible. But most importantly, according to Ambedkar, caste destroyed the concept of ethics and morality. To quote him: “The effect of caste on the ethics of the Hindus is simply deplorable. Caste has killed public spirit. Caste has destroyed the sense of public charity. Caste has made public opinion impossible. A Hindu's public is his caste. His responsibility is to his caste. His loyalty is restricted only to his caste. Virtue has become caste-ridden, and morality has become caste-bound.” Ambedkar ultimately suggested that inter-caste marriage is the only remedy to destroy caste. In The Annihilation of Caste, Ambedkar's critique of the Hindu social order was so strong that Mahatma Gandhi, in Harijan, described Ambedkar as a “challenge to Hinduism”. Ambedkar replied to Gandhi in his usual uncompromising manner. Ambedkar did not spare the socialists or the communists either. He vehemently attacked the communists for their doctrinaire approach to caste in treating it as the superstructure and argued that unless they dealt with caste as a basic structural problem, no worthwhile social change, let alone a socialist revolution, was possible. From the beginning Ambedkar was convinced that political empowerment was key to the socio-economic development of the untouchables. Therefore, he vehemently demanded a separate electorate for untouchables in the Second Round Table Conference in 1932. When the British conceded his demand, Gandhi started his historic fast unto death in the Yerawada jail. Pressure from all corners mounted on Ambedkar to forgo the demand for a separate electorate as the Mahatma's life was at stake. Reluctantly Ambedkar agreed to the formula of a Joint Electorate with reserved seats in legislatures for untouchables. What is the situation today with respect to Ambedkar's mission of annihilation of caste and, in view of that, the relevance of his manifesto of social emancipation? First, the state's reservation policy for the Scheduled Castes (S.Cs) and Scheduled Tribes (S.Ts) has made a positive impact on their socio-economic condition. Though the gap between them and the rest of society persists, and they lag behind the others with respect to many indicators of development, the overall situation has improved. A small strata in all areas of national importance – education, professions, governance, politics, art, literature and so on – has emerged in these communities. This upward occupational mobility has been accompanied by some social prestige, which was unthinkable earlier. The spread of literacy and higher and professional education, the pace of urbanisation, the development of means of communication and transport, and so on have been instrumental in loosening somewhat the rigidity and hangover of the caste system, particularly in the urban areas. Second, and contrary to this positive development, caste has come to be used blatantly and indiscriminately for political ends. This has sharpened caste and sub-caste identities and resulted in caste alliances of different types in different regions for the sole purpose of wielding political power. Thus, while the dominant castes, either in numerical strength or in terms of economic clout, struggle to retain their monopoly over power, the marginal castes, operating on the periphery of the power structure, have aroused their caste consciousness for political mobilisation. POTENT INSTRUMENT Third, since caste is considered a potent instrument for socio-economic and political empowerment, caste and sub-caste organisations have proliferated. There is growing demand by some castes, keeping their caste arrogance intact, to get included in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category, and by some OBCs to be considered as S.Ts (for instance, Jats in Haryana and Rajasthan). This is indeed a trend in reverse. Fourth, the entire trade union movement ignored issues relating to caste owing to total apathy and lack of concern or because of the fear of a rift in the rank and file over the contentious issue of reservation. As a result, there is a growing tendency on the part of the S.Cs and S.Ts in several organisations to form their own associations to fight for their demands. Fifth, Ambedkar suggested inter-caste marriage as the remedy to destroy caste. Today, marriages are preferred not only within castes, but also within sub-castes. In Haryana and Rajasthan, for instance, the khap (caste council) gives orders to kill young lovers for marrying outside their caste. Such inhuman killings are glorified as honour killings. Lastly, atrocities on the S.Cs and S.Ts continue unabated in different parts of the country. They are on two counts: first, owing to the practice of untouchability, resulting in the violation of human and civil rights of these groups, particularly in the rural areas; second, for economic and political reasons. Thus, according to the National Crime Records Bureau of the Union Home Ministry, between 2001 and 2005, the total number of crimes against the S.Cs alone were 1,56, 274, of which 3,406 were of murder and 6,163 were of rape. Various legislative measures such as the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, have proved to be virtually worthless because of the lack of political will to implement them. Ambedkar thought the abolition of untouchability and the eradication of caste would make India an emotionally strong and unified country. His thought and passion are as relevant today as they were 75 years ago. Dr Balachandra Mungekar is a former member of the Planning Commission and former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Mumbai.

This made Ambedkar publically burn the Manusmriti on the occasion of his historical Mahad Satyagraha in 1927 for establishing the right of untouchables to drink the water of the Chawdar tank in Mahad town in Maharashtra. In The Annihilation of Caste, Ambedkar, probably for the first time, raised many profound questions with respect to caste. First, he rejected the defence of caste on the basis of division of labour and argued that it was not merely a division of labour but a division of labourers. The former was voluntary and depended upon one's choice and aptitude and, therefore, rewarded efficiency. The latter was involuntary, forced, killed initiative and resulted in job aversion and inefficiency. He argued that caste could not be defended on the basis of purity of blood, though pollution is a hallmark of the caste system. He quoted from D.R. Bhandarkar's paper “Foreign Elements in the Hindu Population” that “there is hardly any class or caste in India which has not a foreign strain in it, (and that) there is an admixture of alien blood not only among the warrior classes – the Rajputs and the Marathas – but also among the Brahmins who are under the happy delusion that they are free from all foreign elements.” Ambedkar thus argued that caste had no scientific basis. He painfully maintained that Hindu society was a collection of castes, fixed in watertight compartments with graded hierarchy that made an associated corporate life virtually impossible. But most importantly, according to Ambedkar, caste destroyed the concept of ethics and morality. To quote him: “The effect of caste on the ethics of the Hindus is simply deplorable. Caste has killed public spirit. Caste has destroyed the sense of public charity. Caste has made public opinion impossible. A Hindu's public is his caste. His responsibility is to his caste. His loyalty is restricted only to his caste. Virtue has become caste-ridden, and morality has become caste-bound.” Ambedkar ultimately suggested that inter-caste marriage is the only remedy to destroy caste. In The Annihilation of Caste, Ambedkar's critique of the Hindu social order was so strong that Mahatma Gandhi, in Harijan, described Ambedkar as a “challenge to Hinduism”. Ambedkar replied to Gandhi in his usual uncompromising manner. Ambedkar did not spare the socialists or the communists either. He vehemently attacked the communists for their doctrinaire approach to caste in treating it as the superstructure and argued that unless they dealt with caste as a basic structural problem, no worthwhile social change, let alone a socialist revolution, was possible. From the beginning Ambedkar was convinced that political empowerment was key to the socio-economic development of the untouchables. Therefore, he vehemently demanded a separate electorate for untouchables in the Second Round Table Conference in 1932. When the British conceded his demand, Gandhi started his historic fast unto death in the Yerawada jail. Pressure from all corners mounted on Ambedkar to forgo the demand for a separate electorate as the Mahatma's life was at stake. Reluctantly Ambedkar agreed to the formula of a Joint Electorate with reserved seats in legislatures for untouchables. What is the situation today with respect to Ambedkar's mission of annihilation of caste and, in view of that, the relevance of his manifesto of social emancipation? First, the state's reservation policy for the Scheduled Castes (S.Cs) and Scheduled Tribes (S.Ts) has made a positive impact on their socio-economic condition. Though the gap between them and the rest of society persists, and they lag behind the others with respect to many indicators of development, the overall situation has improved. A small strata in all areas of national importance – education, professions, governance, politics, art, literature and so on – has emerged in these communities. This upward occupational mobility has been accompanied by some social prestige, which was unthinkable earlier. The spread of literacy and higher and professional education, the pace of urbanisation, the development of means of communication and transport, and so on have been instrumental in loosening somewhat the rigidity and hangover of the caste system, particularly in the urban areas. Second, and contrary to this positive development, caste has come to be used blatantly and indiscriminately for political ends. This has sharpened caste and sub-caste identities and resulted in caste alliances of different types in different regions for the sole purpose of wielding political power. Thus, while the dominant castes, either in numerical strength or in terms of economic clout, struggle to retain their monopoly over power, the marginal castes, operating on the periphery of the power structure, have aroused their caste consciousness for political mobilisation. POTENT INSTRUMENT Third, since caste is considered a potent instrument for socio-economic and political empowerment, caste and sub-caste organisations have proliferated. There is growing demand by some castes, keeping their caste arrogance intact, to get included in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category, and by some OBCs to be considered as S.Ts (for instance, Jats in Haryana and Rajasthan). This is indeed a trend in reverse. Fourth, the entire trade union movement ignored issues relating to caste owing to total apathy and lack of concern or because of the fear of a rift in the rank and file over the contentious issue of reservation. As a result, there is a growing tendency on the part of the S.Cs and S.Ts in several organisations to form their own associations to fight for their demands. Fifth, Ambedkar suggested inter-caste marriage as the remedy to destroy caste. Today, marriages are preferred not only within castes, but also within sub-castes. In Haryana and Rajasthan, for instance, the khap (caste council) gives orders to kill young lovers for marrying outside their caste. Such inhuman killings are glorified as honour killings. Lastly, atrocities on the S.Cs and S.Ts continue unabated in different parts of the country. They are on two counts: first, owing to the practice of untouchability, resulting in the violation of human and civil rights of these groups, particularly in the rural areas; second, for economic and political reasons. Thus, according to the National Crime Records Bureau of the Union Home Ministry, between 2001 and 2005, the total number of crimes against the S.Cs alone were 1,56, 274, of which 3,406 were of murder and 6,163 were of rape. Various legislative measures such as the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, have proved to be virtually worthless because of the lack of political will to implement them. Ambedkar thought the abolition of untouchability and the eradication of caste would make India an emotionally strong and unified country. His thought and passion are as relevant today as they were 75 years ago. Dr Balachandra Mungekar is a former member of the Planning Commission and former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Mumbai.

Republication or redissemination of the contents of this screen are expressly prohibited without the written consent of Frontline THE Jat Pat Todak Mandal, a social reformist organisation of Lahore, had, in 1936, invited Dr B.R. Ambedkar to deliver the presidential address of its annual conference on the topic of the caste system in India. Ambedkar sent the manuscript of his speech titled The Annihilation of Caste. However, the organising committee found some of his views, particularly his critique of the Vedas and his inclination to leave the Hindu fold, unacceptable. It, therefore, suggested to Ambedkar that he delete these views, to which he replied that “he would not change a comma”. The speech thus remained undelivered. Ambedkar subsequently published it in May 1936. Among the numerous writings and speeches of Ambedkar that run into thousands of pages, The Annihilation of Caste is indeed his magnum opus. Judged by any criterion such as content, logic, argument, language, diction, exposition, urge and, above all, the force, it is a manifesto of social emancipation, and occupies a place similar to what The Communist Manifesto once did in the world communist movement. Since the book is polemical in nature, Ambedkar did not elaborate much on the agonies, indignities, humiliation and overall sufferings of the Sudras, and particularly the untouchables. He only gave illustrations of how they were deprived of education and freedom of occupation and were subjected to stigmatised manual labour, all resulting in their virtual economic slavery, how they were segregated and deprived of basic rights such as drinking water even from public wells, and above all how they were made victims of social persecutions. But, according to Ambedkar, worse and unparalleled, the Hindu Dharmashastras gave legitimacy to the doctrine of Chaturvanya and the caste system. The infamous Manusmriti dehumanised the Sudras and untouchables, ruled the Hindu psyche for centuries and created the greatest obstacle to any serious attempt at eradicating the caste system.
